# /ai-system

Launch an AI/LLM system development workflow.

## Usage

```
/ai-system                       # Start AI system workflow
/ai-system "build a chatbot"     # With initial requirements
```

## Workflow

This command coordinates multiple agents for AI system development:

### 1. Model Orchestrator
- Model selection for different tasks
- Cost/performance trade-offs
- Fallback strategies
- Rate limiting considerations

### 2. LLM Architect
- RAG pipeline design
- Embedding strategy
- Vector database selection
- Prompt engineering patterns
- Context management
- Guardrails and safety

### 3. Developer
- LLM integration code
- RAG pipeline implementation
- Vector store integration
- Prompt templates

### 4. QA
- Prompt testing
- Response quality assessment
- Hallucination detection
- Edge case handling

## When to Use

- Building chatbots or conversational AI
- Implementing RAG systems
- Adding AI features to existing apps
- Creating AI-powered search
- Building content generation tools

## Expected Outputs

- Model selection strategy
- LLM system architecture
- API specification for AI endpoints
- Quality assessment results
