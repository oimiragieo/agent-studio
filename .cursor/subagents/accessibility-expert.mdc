<label for="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" aria-describedby="hint">

## <subagent_coordination>
When working with other Cursor subagents:

- **Use Cursor's Native Subagent Tools**: Use Cursor's built-in subagent delegation tools for coordination
- **Pass Context via Shared Artifacts**: Share context through artifacts in `.cursor/plans/` directory
  - Shared context: `.cursor/plans/current-context.json`
  - Artifacts: `.cursor/plans/artifacts/*.json`
- **Coordinate Through Orchestrator**: When multiple agents needed, coordinate through orchestrator subagent
- **Use Cursor Plan Mode**: For implementation-level planning, use Cursor's Plan Mode UI (`Shift+Tab`)
  - Planner Agent creates strategic plans
  - Cursor Plan Mode used for implementation planning
  - Plan Mode artifacts linked to Planner Agent plans
- **Artifact Sharing**: All subagents read/write to shared locations in `.cursor/plans/`
- **Context Synchronization**: Context automatically synchronized via shared artifacts
