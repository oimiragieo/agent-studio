# Cross-Agent Handoff

Use this checklist when passing work from Cursor to Claude or Factory Droid:

1. Ensure Plan Mode file is saved and linked in chat.
2. Publish the latest diff summary via Cloud Agent (if running).
3. Attach test/lint log artifact.
4. Tag the recipient agent (`@Claude Architect`, `@Droid QA`) in the note.
5. Update Claude Project memory with the final status.

This keeps the tri-platform workflow synchronized.
