## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Routing Deadlock Recovery (2026-01-22)**: Fixed critical routing deadlock that caused permanent session locks (CRITICAL severity)
  - **Stuck Routing Timeout Recovery**: Added 2-minute timeout recovery mechanism
    - Issue: When routing started but never completed (crash/timeout/interruption), the session was permanently locked
    - `no-reroute-after-routing.mjs` blocked router re-runs because routing was "in progress"
    - `router-first-enforcer.mjs` blocked all tools because routing was not "completed"
    - Result: Complete deadlock with no recovery path
  - **Fix in `no-reroute-after-routing.mjs`**:
    - Added `STUCK_ROUTING_TIMEOUT_MS` constant (default: 2 minutes, configurable via env)
    - If routing started > 2 minutes ago and hasn't completed, allow re-routing to recover
    - Block message now shows time until auto-recovery
    - Lines affected: 57-65 (new constant), 165-175 (recovery logic)
  - **Fix in `router-first-enforcer.mjs`**:
    - Added matching `STUCK_ROUTING_TIMEOUT_MS` constant (lines 47-55)
    - When stuck routing detected, automatically reset routing state and allow fresh routing attempt
    - Logs recovery event for debugging (STUCK_ROUTING_RECOVERY error type)
    - Lines affected: 860-892 (recovery logic with state reset)
  - **Fix in `routing-safety-guard.mjs`**: Added missing allowlist entries for Glob during routing
    - Added: `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/templates/`, `.claude/docs/`
    - Previously only allowed: workflows, agents, schemas, config
    - Lines affected: 131-134 (new allowlist entries)
  - **Environment Variable**: `CLAUDE_ROUTER_STUCK_TIMEOUT_MS` to customize recovery timeout

- **Subagent Communication Improvements (2026-01-22)**: Fixed routing handoff enforcement and agent tracking issues
  - **Router Handoff Enforcement (HIGH severity)**: Fixed overly aggressive blocking in `router-first-enforcer.mjs`
    - Issue: Non-coordinator Task spawns (Explore, analyst, developer) were blocked before handoff completion
    - Fix: Added `isCoordinatorName()` helper and modified enforcement to only block coordinator-to-coordinator transitions
    - Worker agents can now be spawned without requiring handoff completion
    - Lines affected: 248-259 (new function), 907-913 (new bypass logic)
  - **SubagentStop Agent Tracking (MEDIUM severity)**: Fixed undefined agent name in `subagent-activity-tracker.mjs`
    - Issue: Claude Code doesn't pass agent name to SubagentStop hooks, making it impossible to track which agent stopped
    - Fix: Implemented stack-based tracking (LIFO) using `agentStack` array
    - On start: push agent name to stack; On stop: pop from stack to identify stopped agent
    - Added `last_stopped_agent` field to state for debugging visibility
    - Lines affected: 78-107 (state schema), 140-155 (stack tracking)
  - **Skills Directories (LOW severity)**: Created missing directories to prevent ENOENT errors
    - `$HOME/.claude/skills/` now created if missing

- **Comprehensive Test Suite Path Issues (2026-01-22)**: Fixed configuration file path resolution in `.claude/tools/comprehensive-test-suite.mjs`
  - Skill Integration Matrix: Changed path from `.claude/context/skill-integration-matrix.json` to `.claude/context/config/skill-integration-matrix.json`
  - Security Triggers Config: Changed path from `.claude/context/security-triggers-v2.json` to `.claude/context/config/security-triggers-v2.json`
  - Fixed JSON key mismatch: Updated agent count lookup to use `matrix.agents || matrix.agent_skills` for compatibility
  - Result: 16/16 tests passing, 0 warnings (previously 2 warnings)

- **Windows Path Handling in hook-runner.mjs (2026-01-22)**: Fixed dynamic import paths for Windows compatibility
  - Issue: `file://${hookPath}` created malformed URLs on Windows (backslashes not converted to forward slashes)
  - Fix: Added `pathToFileURL()` from Node.js `url` module for proper URL construction
  - Lines affected: 62 and 169 in `.claude/tools/hook-runner.mjs`
  - Result: Hooks now load correctly on Windows with paths like `C:\dev\projects\...`

- **Claude CLI Integration Test Shell Escaping (2026-01-22)**: Fixed prompt truncation in `.claude/tools/run-claude-integration-tests.mjs`
  - Issue: Prompts with spaces were truncated (e.g., "What is the codebase structure?" became just "What")
  - Cause: `spawn()` with `shell: true` required proper quote escaping for arguments
  - Fix: Added `escapedPrompt.replace(/"/g, '\\"')` and wrapped prompt in double quotes
  - Result: CLI integration tests now pass 4/4 (100%), previously 2/4 (50%)

- **Security: Hardcoded Webhook Secret Removed (2026-01-22)**: Fixed security vulnerability in `.claude/tools/a2a/push-notification-handler.mjs`
  - Issue: Line 25 had hardcoded fallback `'default-secret'` which is cryptographically weak
  - Fix: Changed to `process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET || null` - secret must now be explicitly configured
  - Added validation in `validateWebhookSignature()` to throw error if secret not configured

- **Crypto: timingSafeEqual Crash Prevention (2026-01-22)**: Fixed potential crash in `.claude/tools/a2a/push-notification-handler.mjs`
  - Issue: `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` throws if buffers have different lengths
  - Fix: Added length check before comparison; wrapped in try/catch; added input validation
  - Lines affected: 174-205 in validateWebhookSignature()

- **Atomic Write for Audit Log Trimming (2026-01-22)**: Fixed race condition in `.claude/hooks/audit-post-tool.mjs`
  - Issue: Read-trim-write operation in `trimAuditLog()` could lose data under concurrent access
  - Fix: Implemented atomic write using temp file + rename pattern
  - Lines affected: 122-162 in trimAuditLog()

- **JSON Parsing Error Handling (2026-01-22)**: Improved error differentiation across multiple files
  - **state-manager.mjs**: `loadState()` now distinguishes file-not-found from JSON corruption errors
  - **state-manager.mjs**: Added try/catch for `--artifact` CLI argument JSON parsing
  - **enforcement-gate.mjs**: `loadJson()` now surfaces JSON parse errors instead of masking them
  - **router-session-handler.mjs**: `loadSettings()`, `loadSessionState()`, and `loadCUJIndex()` now provide specific error messages

- **Memory Leak Prevention (2026-01-22)**: Added array bounds to prevent unbounded growth
  - **state-manager.mjs**: `active_agents` array now capped at 20 entries (line 162)
  - Prevents long-running sessions from accumulating unbounded state

- **Resource Cleanup in Hook Runner (2026-01-22)**: Fixed memory leak in `.claude/tools/hook-runner.mjs`
  - Issue: Event listeners not removed after PowerShell hook execution
  - Fix: Added cleanup function with `removeAllListeners()` and explicit process kill
  - Added manual timeout handler (30s) since spawn's timeout option doesn't work as expected
  - Lines affected: 114-199 in executePlatformHook()

- **File Handle Cleanup Logging (2026-01-22)**: Added debug logging in `.claude/hooks/run-observer.mjs`
  - Issue: `fh.close()` errors were silently ignored
  - Fix: Added conditional warning log when DEBUG env is set
  - Lines affected: 944-949 in readTailText()

- **Workflow Guide Documentation (2026-01-22)**: Added 11 missing workflows to `.claude/workflows/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md`
  - Added: agent-framework-integration, agent-framework-headless, brownfield-onboarding, code-review-flow, conductor-integration, cursor-plan-mode-integration, pr-creation-workflow, search-setup-flow, ship-readiness-headless, recovery-test-flow, fallback-routing-flow
  - Total workflows documented: 25 (previously 14)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Test Suite (2026-01-21)**: Created `.claude/tools/comprehensive-test-suite.mjs` for full framework validation
  - 14 test categories covering critical fixes, syntax validation, schema validation, workflow validation, and hook execution
  - Tests for circular fallback detection, race condition prevention, null safety, and timeout configuration
  - Claude CLI integration test command generation
  - Run with: `node .claude/tools/comprehensive-test-suite.mjs`

- **System Diagnostics Fixes Implemented (2026-01-21)**: All recommended fixes from diagnostics run completed
  - ✅ **Fix 1: Routing Handoff Pattern Automation** - Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` DEFAULT AGENT PROTOCOL to automatically read and use `escalation_target` from routing session state (`.claude/context/tmp/routing-sessions/<session>.json`) after router completes. Expected outcome: Zero "ROUTING HANDOFF REQUIRED" events in future runs.
  - ℹ️ **Fix 2: Missing Skill Directories** - No action required (informational only - expected Claude Code behavior for lazy-loaded skills)
  - ✅ **Fix 3: Tool Search Model Requirements Documentation** - Created comprehensive `.claude/docs/ADVANCED_TOOL_USE.md` (1,200+ lines) documenting that Tool Search requires Sonnet 4.5+/Opus 4.5+ models. Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with Tool Search Requirements section including model support table and Skills recommendation.
  - **Deliverables**: Updated CLAUDE.md, new ADVANCED_TOOL_USE.md documentation, detailed fixes report at `.claude/context/reports/system-diagnostics-fixes-2026-01-21.md`

- **System Diagnostics Run (2026-01-21)**: Comprehensive framework validation completed
  - **Overall Status**: CONCERNS (Functional with Minor Issues)
  - **Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate across all validation layers
  - **Workflows**: 22/22 workflows validated successfully (100%)
  - **Agents**: 38/38 agents validated successfully (100%)
  - **Inventory**: 26 workflows, 38 agents, 46 hooks, 333 tools, 36 tests
  - **Debug Log Analysis**: 2 routing handoff corrections (enforcement working correctly), 2 ENOENT errors (expected behavior)
  - **Performance**: All validations completed within acceptable thresholds
  - **Reports Generated**:
    - System diagnostics report: `.claude/context/reports/system-diagnostics-2026-01-21_115350.md`
    - System diagnostics artifact: `.claude/context/artifacts/system-diagnostics-2026-01-21_115350.json`
    - Master fix plan: `.claude/context/artifacts/diagnostics/diagnostics-master-fix-plan.md`
  - **Top 3 Recommended Fixes** (Priority: Low):
    1. **Routing Handoff Pattern Consistency**: Update default agent/master-orchestrator to automatically read and use `escalation_target` from routing session state after router completes (reduces handoff corrections from 2 to 0)
    2. **Missing Skill Directories ENOENT Errors**: Expected behavior - Claude Code searches for skills in `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\.claude\skills` and `C:\Users\oimir\.claude\skills` (non-existent global locations). This is informational only; no action required unless global skills are desired.
    3. **Tool Search Model Requirements Documentation**: Document in `.claude/docs/ADVANCED_TOOL_USE.md` that Tool Search requires Sonnet/Opus models (Haiku models disable tool_reference blocks by design)

- **Trace/span event fields**: `run-observer.mjs` emits OTel/W3C-compatible `trace_id`/`span_id` fields into `.claude/context/runtime/runs/<runId>/events.ndjson` and `.claude/context/artifacts/tool-events/run-<runId>.ndjson`.
- **Payload storage (sanitized)**: optional full tool payload storage under `.claude/context/payloads/` linked from events via `event.payload.payload_ref` (`CLAUDE_OBS_STORE_PAYLOADS=1`).
- **Failure bundles**: optional trace-linked bundles under `.claude/context/artifacts/failure-bundles/` on tool failures and deny/block events (`CLAUDE_OBS_FAILURE_BUNDLES=1`).
- **A2A protocol test scripts**: `pnpm test:a2a`, `pnpm test:a2a:verbose`, `pnpm test:a2a:ci`.
- **Headless agent smoke runner**: `run-agent-smoke-headless.mjs` runs one agent smoke per `claude -p` process to avoid Claude Code host OOM and writes receipt JSONs under `.claude/context/artifacts/testing/<workflow_id>-agent-smoke/`.
- **Headless integration runner**: `run-agent-framework-integration-headless.mjs` executes the integration workflow phases outside the Claude Code UI to avoid host-process OOM, writing deliverables under `.claude/context/`.
- **UI-safe integration workflow**: `@.claude/workflows/agent-framework-integration-headless.yaml` runs the integration suite via the headless runner (prevents Claude Code UI OOM during integration tests).
- **Ship-readiness headless runner**: `run-ship-readiness-headless.mjs` runs baseline suites + validation and writes auditable report/results under `.claude/context/`.
- **UI-safe ship-readiness workflow**: `@.claude/workflows/ship-readiness-headless.yaml` runs ship readiness audits via the headless runner (reduces Claude Code UI OOM risk).
- **Headless denial test helper**: `run-guard-denial-headless.mjs` triggers `read-path-guard` via `claude -p` and returns a machine-readable summary.
- **Headless verification mode**: `verify-agent-integration.mjs --mode headless` verifies artifact existence/receipts without requiring runtime `events.ndjson` or tool-events streams.
- **Headless run retention cleanup**: `cleanup-headless-runs.mjs` (and `pnpm cleanup:headless`) prunes old headless runs and optional OTLP exports by TTL.
- **OTLP export**: `otlp-export.mjs` converts `events.ndjson` into OTLP/JSON and can POST to an OTLP/HTTP endpoint.
- **Production readiness docs**: `.claude/docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` documents push-button headless runs, retention cleanup, OTLP export, and local RAG tuning.
- **Latest-artifact schema validation**: `validate-latest-integration-artifacts.mjs` (and `pnpm validate:schemas`) validates the newest `*-run-results.json` and agent smoke `_summary.json` against auto-detected schemas.

### Fixed

- **Circular fallback reference (2026-01-21)**: Fixed infinite loop potential in `.claude/config/fallback-agents.json` where `orchestrator` and `master-orchestrator` referenced each other. Changed fallback chain to terminate at `architect` instead, preventing circular delegation loops.

- **Race condition in lock acquisition (2026-01-21)**: Fixed race condition in `.claude/hooks/orchestrator-enforcement-pre-tool.mjs` lock acquisition. Added exponential backoff retry mechanism (3 retries, base 50ms delay), atomic rename for stale lock cleanup, and proper EEXIST error handling to prevent concurrent session corruption.

- **Null safety in router-first-enforcer (2026-01-21)**: Fixed potential null pointer exception in `.claude/hooks/router-first-enforcer.mjs` `extractSessionIdFromState()` function. Added type validation (`!state || typeof state !== 'object' || Array.isArray(state)`) before accessing properties to prevent crashes on malformed session state.

- **Timeout inconsistency (2026-01-21)**: Fixed timeout mismatch in `.claude/hooks/router-first-enforcer.mjs` where documentation stated 2 seconds but code used 900ms. Aligned `FILE_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` to 2000ms to match documented behavior.

- **Router fallback for web app builds**: `router-completion-handler.mjs` now detects web-app/website prompts (e.g., `test_ui`, `cnn.com`) even when router output is missing/unparseable, and falls back to `@.claude/workflows/greenfield-fullstack.yaml` with a required handoff to `orchestrator`.
- **Permission prompt stalls**: added `AskUserQuestion`, `TodoWrite`, and `TaskOutput` to `.claude/settings.json` -> `tool_permissions.always_allow` to prevent sessions from hanging on `canUseTool is required` prompts.
- **read-path-guard relative paths**: directory reads like `.claude/agents/` are now detected reliably even when the hook process is not running with the repo root as CWD (resolves relative paths against `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` / repo root before `statSync`).
- **Debug-mode session key fragmentation**: hook processes now normalize UUID-like `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` values to `shared-<uuid>` and persist them to `.claude/context/tmp/shared-session-key.json`, preventing routing/observability state from splitting across processes (reduces false orchestrator fan-out and Windows OOMs during UI runs).
- **Headless workflow fan-out**: added `headless-task-guard.mjs` to deny `Task` spawning for `*-headless.yaml` workflows after the initial `handoff_target` is spawned (prevents UI sessions from spawning QA/etc and OOMing instead of running the headless runner).
- **Tool naming clarity**: docs/prompts now explicitly state the shell tool is `Bash` (not `BashTool`) to avoid invalid tool call attempts in Claude Code.
- **Claude Code UI OOM from parallel subagents**: added `task-concurrency-guard.mjs` + `subagent-activity-tracker.mjs` to enforce sequential Task spawns for orchestrators (configurable via `CLAUDE_MAX_ACTIVE_SUBAGENTS`, default `1`).
- **Headless smoke reliability**: `run-agent-smoke-headless.mjs` no longer relies on structured-output schema retries by default (agents with strict output formats like `router` previously caused `error_max_structured_output_retries` failures); it now writes a derived receipt when output is non-standard.
- **Headless smoke timeouts**: hung `claude -p` processes are now killed reliably on Windows via `taskkill /T /F` when per-agent timeouts trigger (prevents the smoke runner from stalling indefinitely).
- **Workflow runner recovery**: `workflow_runner.js` now calls `prepareRecovery()` in the top-level `main().catch(...)` path when a run context is available, enabling resume from the last successful step after unexpected failures.
- **Formatter optional dirs**: `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check` now tolerate missing tracked files under optional directories (`.opencode/`, `.factory/`) instead of failing the whole format run.
- **A2A integration suite**: restored missing fixtures, aligned scenarios with hook schemas (`approve`/`deny`), and improved harness assertions so `node .claude/tests/a2a-framework/test-runner.mjs --ci` passes end-to-end.
- **Integration verifier smoke summary drift**: `verify-agent-integration.mjs` now warns when `_summary.json` totals don't match the receipt file count (helps catch accidental agent exclusions).
- **Router-first handoff deadlocks**: `router-first-enforcer.mjs` now treats `orchestrator` and `master-orchestrator` as equivalent coordinators for post-routing handoff, preventing repeated `ROUTING HANDOFF REQUIRED` blocks when the model spawns the other coordinator variant.
- **Router re-route OOM race**: `no-reroute-after-routing.mjs` now blocks attempts to spawn `router` again while routing is in progress (and briefly after completion), preventing token-amplifying re-routing loops while still allowing re-routing on later user turns.
- **Multi-turn routing dead-ends**: `router-first-enforcer.mjs` now resets the active routing state when a new `router` spawn occurs after routing has completed, allowing subsequent user prompts to be routed again in the same session (prevents “Hook PreToolUse:Task denied this tool” stalls).
- **Integration vs diagnostics misroute**: `router-completion-handler.mjs` now treats integration harness prompts as higher priority than “diagnostics” wording, and rewrites `diagnostics-runner` escalation to `orchestrator` when the integration workflow is selected.
- **Miswired router hook**: `.claude/settings.json` no longer runs `router-session-entry.mjs` as a Claude Code hook (it is not a stdin/decision hook), reducing re-routing loops and OOM risk.

### Changed

- **Safer Claude Code defaults**: repo-scoped `.claude/settings.json` no longer force-enables payload storage/failure bundles and disables `extended_thinking` by default to reduce OOM risk during long integration runs (enable locally via environment or `.claude/settings.local.json`).
- **Coordinator “no phantom execution”**: `master-orchestrator` and `orchestrator` instructions now forbid claiming progress without a successful `Task` result and require following hook denial banners immediately.
- **RAG defaults + tuning**: `.claude/settings.json` enables RAG by default; use `.claude/templates/settings.local.example.json` to disable background indexing and reduce batch sizes if you hit memory pressure during debug runs.
- **Headless integration JSON suite**: `pnpm integration:headless:json` now enables payload storage and runs the denial test as part of the default headless workflow output.
- **Router integration routing**: integration harness requests now prefer `@.claude/workflows/agent-framework-integration-headless.yaml` to keep the Claude Code UI stable.
- **Ship readiness routing**: ship readiness prompts now prefer `@.claude/workflows/ship-readiness-headless.yaml` and disable post-routing handoff to avoid orchestrator fan-out.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Workflow artifact schema coverage**: added schemas for additional structured outputs and wired them into workflows via `validation.schema` / `secondary_outputs`.

### Changed

- **Workflow dry-run signal quality**: reduced non-actionable warnings by validating more structured artifacts (warnings: 117 → 20 in the dry-run suite).

### Fixed

- **Formatting when `.opencode/` is missing**: `pnpm format` now skips tracked `.opencode/` paths that are missing on disk (e.g., when temporarily renamed to `.opencode.disabled/`) instead of failing.
- **Hook test expectations**: updated fixtures to expect `decision: "approve"` (aligns with current hook output schema).

## [2.2.3] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Tool search diagnostics noise reduction**: system diagnostics now treat "Tool Search disabled" log lines as non-blocking and report them separately.
- **Router JSON parsing hardening**: router completion handler now strips code fences, handles single-quoted JSON, and logs sanitized samples on parse failures.
- **Router JSON parsing tests**: added regression coverage for malformed router JSON handling in completion parsing.
- **Tool Search requirements docs**: documented model/tool requirements and Haiku limitation in CLAUDE.md; diagnostics runner notes MCPSearchTool omission.

- **PreToolUse denial logging**: Denied tool calls are now captured even when PostToolUse hooks don’t run (tool never executed).
  - Tool events: `.claude/context/artifacts/tool-events/run-<runId>.ndjson` (look for `"denied": true`)
  - Orphan denials (no run yet): `.claude/context/artifacts/tool-events/orphan-denials.ndjson`
- **Routing decision artifacts**: Router decisions are now persisted to `.claude/context/artifacts/routing/<sessionKey>.json` for provable routing audits.
- **Agent task completion artifacts**: Durable per-agent JSON summaries under `.claude/context/artifacts/agents/<sessionKey>/`.
- **Denial logger diagnostics**: `.claude/context/logs/{denial-logger-errors.log,denial-logger-warnings.log}` for fail-open debugging.
- **Sensitive token redaction**: Denial events and denial-logger diagnostics redact `github_pat_...` and `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...`.
- **Subagent attribution hardening**: `run-observer.mjs` now reliably attributes `SubagentStart/SubagentStop` even when Claude Code omits agent context, using a `Task` delegation queue + parent stack.
  - Stale pending entries are dropped after ~3 minutes (override via `CLAUDE_PENDING_SUBAGENT_TTL_MS`)
  - New state metrics: `pending_subagents_max`, `subagent_parent_stack_max`, `pending_subagents_stale_dropped`

### Changed

- **Router agent tool access**: Router now includes `Glob` to safely discover files before `Read`.
- **Router completion handler robustness**: Increased tool result capture limits and accepts `shouldRoute` (camelCase) as a routing boolean.
- **Headless integration defaults**: `pnpm integration:headless:json` now uses a safer per-agent timeout (`--timeout-ms 90000`) for real `claude -p` runs.
- **Integration routing (headless)**: `router-completion-handler.mjs` prefers `@.claude/workflows/agent-framework-integration-headless.yaml` and does not force a Task handoff for headless integration runs (reduces nested routing/subagent spawn OOM risk).
- **Observability coverage**: `run-observer.mjs` is configured to record PreToolUse/PostToolUse for all tools (not just a subset), eliminating “missing PostToolUse hook” blind spots.
- **Diagnostics fix plan location**: `system-diagnostics.mjs` now writes the fix plan to `.claude/context/artifacts/diagnostics/diagnostics-master-fix-plan.md` by default (legacy root path available via `--legacy-root-fix-plan`).

### Fixed

- **Observability gap**: PreToolUse denials were previously invisible in tool event artifacts because PostToolUse never ran for blocked tools.
- **Router JSON extraction edge cases**: Improved resilience when router output contains minor JSON formatting issues, and fixed string escape handling in JSON object extraction.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Optional Serena MCP integration**: Added `mcpServers.serena` to `.claude/.mcp.json` plus setup docs (`.claude/docs/SERENA_INTEGRATION.md`).
- **Read-only mode**: Added `.claude/hooks/read-only-enforcer.mjs` and `node .claude/tools/read-only.mjs` to block `Write`/`Edit` and mutating `Bash` during audits/diagnostics.
- **Tool-events dashboard**: Added `node .claude/tools/tool-events-dashboard.mjs` to summarize `.claude/context/artifacts/tool-events/run-<runId>.ndjson`.
- **Client contexts**: Added `.claude/config/client-contexts.json` and `node .claude/tools/client-context.mjs` (lightweight context profiles).

### Changed

- **Hook response standardization**: Standardized all hook scripts, docs, and specs to use `decision: "approve"` instead of `decision: "allow"` for consistency with Claude Code's hook schema validation.
- **Temp cloning hygiene**: Added `.tmp/` to `.gitignore` for safe external repo deep-dives.
- **Read-only Bash heuristics**: Treat common `git` read-only commands as explicitly safe while continuing to block staging/history mutations.
- **Tool-events dashboard filtering**: Added `--since` filtering for time-bounded tool event queries.
- **Client context ergonomics**: Added `detect` helper command (`node .claude/tools/client-context.mjs detect [--apply]`).
- **Router handoff clarity**: Router schema/docs now include `should_escalate` and `escalation_target` to enable proactive agent handoff (avoid “ROUTING HANDOFF REQUIRED” denials).
- **Handoff UX**: Orchestrators now prefer parsing the router JSON decision first, with the handoff denial message as fallback (avoids extra agent spawns and aligns with router JSON contract).
- **OOM guard for routing-phase Glob**: Added `router-glob-guard.mjs` to block non-`.claude/` repo-wide `Glob` patterns during routing (prevents massive tool output / CLI OOM).
- **Router completion reliability**: Increased PostToolUse stdin capture timeout in `router-completion-handler.mjs` to reduce false “decision parse failed” fallbacks when Task results arrive slowly.
- **Handoff observability**: `run-observer.mjs` now writes `.claude/context/artifacts/routing-handoff/run-<runId>.json` to indicate whether the handoff target was spawned proactively or after a handoff denial.
- **Routing-in-progress UX**: Improved router-first block messaging once routing has started (avoids the confusing “request must be routed” banner during router activity) and clarified router guidance to avoid `Grep` during routing.
- **Routing safety guard**: Added `routing-safety-guard.mjs` to block `Grep`/`Search` and restrict `Glob` to small routing config scopes while routing is in progress (reduces risk of CLI OOM during routing).

---

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Iteration loop state (self-healing groundwork)**: Added `.claude/tools/iteration-state-manager.mjs` to persist iteration state for “rate → fix → retest → rerate” loops.
- **Session key sliding refresh test**: Added `tests/session-key.test.mjs` to ensure the shared session key expiry is refreshed (prevents long-run state fragmentation).

### Changed

- **Long-running routing reliability**: Extended shared session key TTL and made it sliding/refreshable to avoid mid-session expiry causing routing deadlocks.
  - Updated `.claude/hooks/session-key.mjs` (sliding refresh + longer TTL)
  - Updated `.claude/hooks/session-start.mjs` (longer session key TTL at session start)
- **Router-first enforcement durability**: Extended routing session TTL and made it sliding (refreshed on every state write) to support multi-hour runs without expiring routing state mid-workflow.
  - Updated `.claude/hooks/router-first-enforcer.mjs`
  - Updated `.claude/hooks/router-completion-handler.mjs`
  - Updated `.claude/hooks/router-first-enforcer.mjs.spec.md`

## [Unreleased] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed - Validation Infrastructure

#### Core Validation Fixes (Phase 1-2)

- **Fixed .mcp.json validation parser** - Correctly navigates `mcpServers` nested structure instead of treating top-level keys as servers (Issue #1)
- **Fixed CUJ-INDEX table parser** - Updated separator detection regex to handle variable spacing (e.g., `| ------- |` and `|---|` formats) (Issue #3)
- **Fixed skill validation in validate-config.mjs** - Made `allowed-tools` and `version` fields optional for skills (78 skills were failing validation) (Issue #1)
- **Fixed agent/skill detection in sync-cuj-registry.mjs** - Added patterns for `- **agent**:` and `- **skill**:` formats (only backticks were detected) (Issue #4)
- **Fixed registry schema** - Added "Search & Discovery" to allowed CUJ category enum (Issue #8)
- **Updated package.json scripts** - All `validate:cujs:*` and `cuj:doctor*` scripts now use unified validator (cuj-validator-unified.mjs) (Issue #15)

#### CUJ & Workflow Fixes (Phase 3)

- **Fixed CUJ-064 end-to-end** - Changed invalid execution mode "skill-workflow" to canonical "workflow", resolved missing schema references (Issue #2)
- **Fixed template workflows for dry-run** - Added template detection and placeholder handling to allow `{{placeholder}}` substitution in workflow files without breaking validation (Issue #3, Step 3.3)
- **Added Step 0.1 plan-rating gate** - Implemented plan rating validation with offline fallback for network unavailability (Step 3.2, 3.5)
- **Normalized execution modes across CUJs** - All CUJs now use canonical modes: `workflow`, `skill-only`, or `manual-setup` (Issue #6, Step 3.4)
- **Fixed Tools vs Skills pattern** - Documented distinction between MCP tools (Capabilities/Tools Used) and skills (Skills Used) to prevent validation false positives (Issue #7, Step 3.6)
- **Fixed run-cuj.mjs** - Removed unused `waitingQueue` variable, added `--ci`, `--no-analytics`, `--no-side-effects` flags (Issue #10, Step 4.2)

#### Documentation Updates (Phase 4)

- **Updated CUJ template** - Added canonical execution modes with clear examples and deprecated format warnings (Step 3.4)
- **Updated WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md** - Documented template workflow handling, plan-rating gate requirements, Step 0/0.1 structure (Step 3.2, 3.3)
- **Updated CUJ_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md** - Added execution modes section, updated tool/script references, pointing to cuj-validator-unified.mjs (Step 2.4)
- **Verified EXECUTION_MODE_STANDARD.md** - Canonical mode schema with migration path (created in Step 1.4)
- **Verified EXECUTION_MODE_MIGRATION.md** - Migration guide for CUJ authors (created in Step 1.4)

### Added - Validation Infrastructure

#### Core Additions

- **Canonical Execution Mode Schema** - Three standard modes: `workflow` (multi-agent YAML), `skill-only` (direct skill), `manual-setup` (no automation) (Step 1.4)
- **Plan-Rating Gate with Offline Fallback** - Validates plan quality (min 7/10) before workflow execution; falls back to rule-based scoring when network unavailable (Step 3.2, 3.5)
- **Template Workflow Support** - Workflows can contain `{{placeholder}}` substitutions that are validated without literal file checks (Step 3.3)
- **Improved Dry-Run Validation** - Templates, offline scoring, and no-write modes enable CI-friendly validation (Step 4.1)

#### Documentation Additions

- **EXECUTION_MODE_STANDARD.md** - Authoritative documentation of canonical execution modes with examples (Step 1.4)
- **EXECUTION_MODE_MIGRATION.md** - Migration guide for existing CUJs to new canonical modes (Step 1.4)
- **Updated Templates** - CUJ template now shows canonical modes, plan-rating gate requirements, Tools vs Skills distinction (Step 3.6)

### Changed - Validation Infrastructure

- **CUJ validation now supports** template placeholders without breaking on missing agent files (Step 3.3)
- **Plan-rating gate** is mandatory for all workflow-mode CUJs (Step 3.2)
- **Offline fallback** enables validation to proceed without network/response-rater skill (Step 3.5)
- **Tool/Skill distinction** prevents false "missing skill" warnings for MCP tools like Chrome DevTools (Step 3.6)

### Breaking Changes

- **Execution modes standardized** - Old formats (raw YAML filenames like `greenfield-fullstack.yaml` in execution_mode field) are deprecated. Use canonical `workflow` mode with separate `Workflow File:` field.
- **Package.json scripts updated** - Old validation tools deprecated in favor of cuj-validator-unified.mjs (Issue #15)

### Migration Required

CUJ authors should review `.claude/docs/EXECUTION_MODE_MIGRATION.md` to:

1. Update execution mode to canonical value
2. Move workflow filename to separate "Workflow File:" field
3. Verify Tools vs Skills sections are correctly separated
4. Run `pnpm validate` to confirm migration

See `.claude/docs/EXECUTION_MODE_MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration steps.

### Test Coverage

- **New validators tested** - All validation scripts now include unit tests for edge cases
- **Regression prevention** - Comprehensive test suite for .mcp.json, CUJ-INDEX, skill validation, registry sync
- **Dry-run compatibility** - All validators support `--dry-run` mode without state mutations
