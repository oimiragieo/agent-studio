  "summary": "The response correctly identifies Express.js as the framework but provides only surface-level guidance. It lacks code examples, middleware setup, security considerations, and specific implementation details. While brief, it fails to give actionable steps that would enable a developer to successfully implement a REST API.",
  "improvements": [
    "Include a minimal code example showing server initialization and basic route structure",
    "Mention essential middleware like body-parser (or express.json()) for POST/PUT requests",
    "Specify error handling middleware pattern (app.use with 4-parameter function)",
    "Add security basics: input validation library (e.g., express-validator) and CORS configuration",
    "Clarify project structure: where to place routes, controllers, and server entry point",
    "Include async/await or promise handling for database operations",
    "Mention environment variables for port configuration and sensitive data",
    "Reference testing approach (supertest) or at least mention testing importance",
    "Specify HTTP status codes to return (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)",
    "Add note about API documentation tools (Swagger/OpenAPI) for production APIs"
  ],
  "rewrite": "To implement a REST API in Node.js, use Express.js: `npm install express`. Create `server.js` with `const app = express(); app.use(express.json());`. Define routes (app.get/post/put/delete) with async handlers. Add error middleware: `app.use((err, req, res, next) => res.status(500).json({error: err.message}))`. Validate inputs with express-validator. Configure CORS if needed. Start server with `app.listen(3000)`. Use environment variables for port and secrets."
