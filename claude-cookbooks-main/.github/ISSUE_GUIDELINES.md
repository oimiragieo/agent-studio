# Issue & Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Claude Cookbooks! This guide helps you understand what types of contributions we welcome and how to make them effectively.

## Before You Open an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** - Your question or bug may already be reported
2. **Check the docs** - Many questions are answered in [Claude Documentation](https://docs.claude.com)
3. **Review CONTRIBUTING.md** - For development setup and contribution guidelines

## Issue Types

### Bug Reports

Use bug reports for:
- Broken links or missing files
- Code that doesn't execute properly
- Incorrect or outdated information
- Missing dependencies or setup issues

**Good bug reports include:**
- Specific file/notebook affected
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (Python version, OS)

### Cookbook Proposals

We welcome proposals for new cookbooks that demonstrate Claude's capabilities. Before proposing:

**We're looking for:**
- Notebooks that showcase Claude API/SDK capabilities directly
- Practical, real-world use cases
- Clear educational value with problem-focused learning
- Self-contained examples that users can run immediately

**We generally don't accept:**
- Translations of external frameworks or projects into the SDK
- Notebooks that primarily promote external tools or services
- Content that duplicates existing official documentation
- Proposals without concrete implementation plans

**Strong proposals include:**
1. **Problem statement** - What problem does this solve for users?
2. **Claude capabilities** - Which API/SDK features does this demonstrate?
3. **Learning objectives** - What will users learn?
4. **Outline** - High-level structure of the proposed notebook
5. **Differentiation** - How is this different from existing cookbooks?
