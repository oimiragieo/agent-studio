        **We're looking for notebooks that:**
        - Showcase Claude API/SDK capabilities directly
        - Solve practical, real-world problems
        - Provide clear educational value
        - Are self-contained and runnable

        - label: I have searched existing cookbooks and this topic isn't already covered
          required: true
        - label: This proposal focuses on Claude API/SDK capabilities (not external frameworks)
          required: true
        - label: I am prepared to implement this cookbook (or have a clear implementation plan)

      description: What problem does this cookbook solve? Why would users need this?
      placeholder: |
        Users often need to process large documents but don't know how to efficiently
        chunk and summarize them while maintaining context. This leads to poor results
        when using naive approaches...

      label: Differentiation
      description: How is this different from existing cookbooks or documentation?
      placeholder: |
        The existing RAG cookbook focuses on retrieval, but doesn't cover the
        summarization workflow. This fills that gap by showing end-to-end
        document processing...
