# Security Architect Workflow

Orchestrate comprehensive security audits using multi-phase threat analysis, vulnerability scanning, and remediation planning with OWASP Top 10 coverage.

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach to security assessment that covers the full lifecycle from threat identification to remediation. It integrates multiple specialized agents and follows industry-standard frameworks (OWASP, STRIDE, CWE) to ensure thorough security coverage.

**Extended Thinking**: Security is not a one-time activity but a continuous process. This workflow ensures that security considerations are embedded throughout the development lifecycle. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a comprehensive security posture that addresses both immediate vulnerabilities and systemic weaknesses.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Description | Recommended Frequency |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Pre-Release** | Before deploying to production | Every release |
| **Post-Incident** | After security breach or near-miss | Immediately after incident |
| **Periodic Audit** | Scheduled security review | Quarterly |
| **New Feature** | Major feature with security implications | Before feature GA |
| **Dependency Update** | After major dependency changes | As needed |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory or certification requirements | Per compliance schedule |

## Configuration Options

### Audit Scope

- **full**: Complete security audit (all 5 phases)
- **quick**: Rapid assessment (Phases 1-3 only)
- **targeted**: Specific vulnerability focus
- **compliance**: Regulatory compliance focus (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)

### Risk Appetite

- **conservative**: Block on any Medium+ findings
- **balanced**: Block on High+ findings (default)
- **aggressive**: Block on Critical only

## Phase 1: Threat Modeling

**Agent**: Security Architect
**Skill**: `security-architect`
**Duration**: 2-4 hours

### Step 1.1: Attack Surface Identification

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  model: 'opus',
  description: 'Threat modeling - attack surface identification',
  prompt: `You are the SECURITY-ARCHITECT agent.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
PROJECT_ROOT: C:\\dev\\projects\\agent-studio

## Task
Identify attack surfaces for: $TARGET_SYSTEM

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/specialized/security-architect.md
2. **Invoke skill**: Skill({ skill: "security-architect" })
3. Map all entry points: APIs, UI inputs, file uploads, external integrations
4. Identify trust boundaries and data flows
5. Document authentication and authorization boundaries
6. Create attack surface diagram
7. Save output to: .claude/context/reports/security/attack-surface.md

## STRIDE Analysis Required
For each entry point, analyze:

## Security Gates

### Pre-Release Gate Criteria

The following conditions BLOCK deployment:
