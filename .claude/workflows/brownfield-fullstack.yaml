# NOTE: This workflow is selected via keywords defined in .claude/config.yaml workflow_selection section.
# The routing system matches user prompts against keywords in config.yaml, not this file.
# See .claude/config.yaml for the authoritative keyword list used by the routing system.

# This workflow is optimized for existing projects:
# - Emphasizes impact analysis and compatibility
# - Includes migration planning and rollback strategies
# - Focuses on incremental improvements
