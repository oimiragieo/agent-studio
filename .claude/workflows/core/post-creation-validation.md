# Post-Creation Validation Workflow

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2026-01-28
**Purpose:** Prevent "Invisible Artifact" pattern by validating integration completeness after artifact creation

## Overview

This workflow ensures that all created artifacts are properly integrated into the ecosystem before being considered complete. It addresses the gap identified in the Party Mode incident where a fully-implemented feature was invisible to the Router due to missing CLAUDE.md routing entry.

## When to Use

- **MANDATORY** after ANY artifact creation via creator skills
- After restoring archived artifacts
- After manual artifact creation (emergency cases only)
- During periodic ecosystem health checks

## The 10-Item Integration Checklist

Every created artifact MUST pass all applicable items before the creator skill marks its task as complete.

### Checklist

### Detailed Validation Steps

#### Item 1: CLAUDE.md Routing Entry

**Applies to:** Agents, Workflows

**Why:** Artifacts not in CLAUDE.md routing table are invisible to the Router.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# For agents
grep -i "<agent-name>" .claude/CLAUDE.md | grep -i "routing table"

# For workflows
grep -i "<workflow-name>" .claude/CLAUDE.md | grep -i "workflow"
```

**Common failures:**

- Agent created but table not updated
- Workflow created but not added to Enterprise Workflows section

#### Item 2: Skill Catalog Entry

**Applies to:** Skills

**Why:** Skills not in catalog are undiscoverable by agents.

**How to validate:**

```bash
grep -i "<skill-name>" .claude/context/artifacts/skill-catalog.md
```

**Common failures:**

- Skill SKILL.md created but catalog not updated
- Skill category mismatch in catalog

#### Item 3: Router Enforcer Keywords

**Applies to:** Agents

**Why:** Router uses keywords to match requests to agents.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Check intentKeywords
grep -i "<domain-keyword>" .claude/hooks/routing/router-enforcer.cjs

# Check INTENT_TO_AGENT mapping
grep -i "<agent-name>" .claude/hooks/routing/router-enforcer.cjs
```

**Common failures:**

- No keywords added for new domain agent
- Keywords added but not mapped to agent

#### Item 4: Agent Assignment

**Applies to:** Skills, Workflows

**Why:** Unassigned skills/workflows cannot be invoked through agent routing.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Check if skill is assigned to any agent
grep -r "<skill-name>" .claude/agents/
```

**Common failures:**

- Skill created but no agent lists it
- Workflow created but no agent references it

#### Item 5: Memory File Updates

**Applies to:** All artifacts

**Why:** Memory files capture learnings and decisions for future sessions.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Check for recent updates mentioning artifact
grep -i "<artifact-name>" .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
grep -i "<artifact-name>" .claude/context/memory/decisions.md
```

**Common failures:**

- No learning recorded from creation process
- No decision record for design choices

#### Item 6: Schema Validation

**Applies to:** All artifacts with schemas

**Why:** Invalid schema = unpredictable behavior.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Use ecosystem validator
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-agents.mjs <artifact-path>
```

**Common failures:**

- Missing required YAML frontmatter fields
- Invalid field values

#### Item 7: Tests Passing

**Applies to:** All artifacts with tests

**Why:** Failing tests = broken functionality.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Run tests for specific artifact
npm test -- --grep "<artifact-name>"
```

**Common failures:**

- Tests written but not run before completion
- Tests passing locally but not in CI

#### Item 8: Documentation Complete

**Applies to:** All artifacts

**Why:** Incomplete docs = unusable artifact.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Check for placeholder text
grep -i "TODO\|TBD\|FIXME\|<fill" <artifact-path>
```

**Common failures:**

- Template placeholders not replaced
- Sections left empty

#### Item 9: Evolution State Updated

**Applies to:** All artifacts

**Why:** Evolution state is the audit trail.

**How to validate:**

```bash
# Check evolution-state.json
grep -i "<artifact-name>" .claude/context/evolution-state.json
```

**Common failures:**

- Evolution started but not completed in state
- Missing completion timestamp

#### Item 10: Router Discoverability

**Applies to:** Agents, Skills

**Why:** The ultimate test - can the Router actually use this artifact?

**How to validate:**

```
# Manual test
Ask Router: "I need help with <artifact-domain>"
# Should route to newly created artifact
```

**Common failures:**

- All registrations complete but Router logic has bug
- Keywords conflict with another agent

## Validation CLI Tool

Use the automated validation tool:

```bash
# Validate a single artifact
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-integration.cjs <artifact-path>

# Validate all recently created artifacts
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-integration.cjs --recent

# Exit codes
# 0 = All checks passed
# 1 = One or more checks failed
```

---

## Integration with Creator Skills

All creator skills MUST include this validation step BEFORE marking task complete:

### Required Step in Creator Skills

```markdown
## Step N: Integration Verification (BLOCKING)

BEFORE calling TaskUpdate({ status: "completed" }):

1. Run the 10-item checklist (above)
2. Run: `node .claude/tools/cli/validate-integration.cjs <artifact-path>`
3. Verify exit code is 0
4. If exit code is 1:
   - Read error output for specific failures
   - Fix each failure
   - Re-run validation
   - Only proceed when exit code is 0

This step is BLOCKING. Do NOT mark task complete until validation passes.
```

---

## Session Reminder Hook

A session hook reminds agents about recently created artifacts that may need integration verification:

**Hook:** `.claude/hooks/session/post-creation-reminder.cjs`

**Behavior:**

- Checks evolution-state.json for completions in last 24 hours
- Runs validation on those artifacts
- Outputs reminder if any fail validation

---

## Failure Recovery

### If Validation Fails After Task Marked Complete

1. Create follow-up task for remediation
2. Run validation to identify specific failures
3. Fix each failure
4. Re-run validation until passing
5. Update evolution-state.json with fix record

### If Artifact Already Deployed with Missing Integration

1. **Immediate:** Add missing registrations
2. **Root cause:** Determine why validation was skipped
3. **Prevention:** Ensure validation step is BLOCKING in creator skill

## Metrics

Track these metrics to measure workflow effectiveness:

| Metric                       | Target  | How to Measure                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Integration completion rate  | 100%    | Artifacts passing all 10 items / Total artifacts |
| Time to integration          | < 5 min | Time from artifact creation to validation pass   |
| Invisible artifact incidents | 0       | Count of artifacts found without routing entry   |
| Validation failure rate      | < 10%   | Failed first validations / Total validations     |
