**Extended Thinking**: External integrations pose significant risks: code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, dependency conflicts, and framework incompatibilities. This workflow establishes a robust multi-phase validation process using isolated environments, parallel expert reviews, and rollback procedures. The workflow prioritizes safety over speed by never polluting the main codebase until all validations pass.

## ROUTER UPDATE REQUIRED (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)

**After creating this workflow, you MUST update CLAUDE.md:**

1. Add to Section 3 "Multi-Agent Workflows" with path reference
2. Update Section 8.6 "ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS" with full workflow entry
3. Update learnings.md with integration summary

**Verification:**
```bash
grep "external-integration" .claude/CLAUDE.md || echo "ERROR: CLAUDE.md NOT UPDATED!"
```

**WHY**: Workflows not documented in CLAUDE.md will never be invoked by the Router.

---

## Configuration Options

### Integration Source

- **github**: GitHub repository URL
- **local**: Local directory path
- **archive**: .zip or .tar.gz archive file
- **url**: Direct URL to downloadable artifact

### Artifact Type

- **skill**: Skill with SKILL.md and supporting scripts
- **agent**: Agent definition markdown file
- **workflow**: Multi-agent orchestration workflow
- **template**: Code or artifact template
- **hook**: Pre/post tool execution hook
- **mixed**: Repository contains multiple artifact types

### Risk Level

- **low**: Well-known source, simple artifacts, no dependencies
- **medium**: Unknown source OR complex artifacts OR external dependencies
- **high**: Security-sensitive OR supply chain concerns OR framework modifications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow:

1. **Required context**: Source URL or path to external artifact
2. **Required permissions**: Write access to `.claude/` directories
3. **Required tools**: Git (for GitHub cloning), unzip/tar (for archives)
4. **Safety check**: Ensure `.claude/context/tmp/` is writable and gitignored

## Phase 0: Pre-Check

### Step 0.1: Check Local Existence

**Agent**: architect

**Task Spawn**:

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Architect checking if artifact exists locally',
  prompt: `You are the ARCHITECT agent.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
PROJECT_ROOT: C:\\dev\\projects\\agent-studio
All operations relative to PROJECT_ROOT.

## Task
Check if artifact already exists in the framework before integration.

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/core/architect.md
2. **Invoke skills**: Skill({ skill: "repo-rag" })
3. Search for artifact by name in:
   - .claude/agents/ (if integrating agent)
   - .claude/skills/ (if integrating skill)
   - .claude/workflows/ (if integrating workflow)
   - .claude/templates/ (if integrating template)
   - .claude/hooks/ (if integrating hook)
4. If artifact exists:
   - Compare versions (if versioned)
   - Determine if update is needed
   - Save findings to: .claude/context/tmp/pre-check-results.md
5. If artifact does NOT exist:
   - Document in .claude/context/tmp/pre-check-results.md
   - Indicate integration should proceed

## Output
- .claude/context/tmp/pre-check-results.md with existence check results

## Memory Protocol
1. Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md first
2. Record findings to .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
`,
});
```

**Expected Output**: `.claude/context/tmp/pre-check-results.md` with artifact existence status and version comparison

**Gate Decision**: If artifact exists and is up-to-date, STOP workflow. If update needed or new artifact, proceed to Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Clone & Isolate

### Step 1.1: Clone to Temporary Location

**Agent**: developer

**Task Spawn**:

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Developer cloning external artifact to isolated temp directory',
  prompt: `You are the DEVELOPER agent.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
PROJECT_ROOT: C:\\dev\\projects\\agent-studio
All operations relative to PROJECT_ROOT.

## Task
Clone external artifact to isolated temporary directory for validation.

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/core/developer.md
2. Create isolation directory: .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/
3. Clone/download artifact to isolation directory:
   - For GitHub repos: git clone <url> .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/
   - For archives: extract to .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/
   - For local: copy to .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/
4. Verify clone succeeded (check for expected files)
5. Document directory structure in: .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/STRUCTURE.md

## Critical Safety Rules
- NEVER copy directly to .claude/agents/, .claude/skills/, etc.
- ALL external code stays in .claude/context/tmp/ until validated
- If clone fails, document error and STOP workflow

## Output
- .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/ populated with external code
- .claude/context/tmp/<repo-name>/STRUCTURE.md with directory structure

## Memory Protocol
1. Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md first
2. Record any clone issues to .claude/context/memory/issues.md

   - Check for typosquatting package names
   - Verify no install-time binary downloads
   - Check for pinned versions and integrity checksums
7. **Data Exfiltration Prevention**:
   - Check for hardcoded exfiltration URLs
   - Verify no credential harvesting (.ssh, .aws, .npmrc scanning)
   - Check for suspicious network calls in init code
   - Flag any telemetry that collects sensitive data
8. Document findings in: .claude/context/reports/security-review.md

## Security Checklist
- [ ] No malicious code detected
- [ ] Dependencies have no known CVEs
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Filesystem access is scoped

- [ ] Check for pinned vs unpinned versions (prefer pinned for security)
- [ ] Verify integrity checksums where available (package-lock.json, yarn.lock)
- [ ] Check transitive dependencies for known vulnerabilities

### Data Exfiltration Prevention

- [ ] Check for hardcoded URLs that could exfiltrate data
- [ ] Check for environment variable access patterns (especially secrets)
- [ ] Verify no credential harvesting patterns (password, token, key collection)
- [ ] Check for suspicious network calls in initialization code
- [ ] Review any telemetry or analytics code for data leakage
- [ ] Check for base64 encoding of sensitive data before transmission
- [ ] Verify no filesystem scanning for credentials (.ssh, .aws, .npmrc)
- [ ] Check for clipboard access or keylogging patterns

## Output
- .claude/context/reports/security-review.md with security assessment

## CRITICAL
- Flag ANY security concerns as BLOCKING issues
- Recommend mitigation strategies for each finding
- Script execution vulnerabilities are ALWAYS BLOCKING
- Dependency vulnerabilities with CVSS >= 7.0 are BLOCKING
- Data exfiltration patterns are ALWAYS BLOCKING

## Memory Protocol

## Error Recovery

### If Phase 0 determines artifact exists and is current:

1. Document decision in learnings.md
2. STOP workflow - no integration needed
3. Notify user: "Artifact already exists and is up-to-date"

### If Phase 1 clone/download fails:

1. Document error in issues.md
2. Check network connectivity, permissions, URL validity
3. Retry clone with corrected parameters
4. If persistent failure, STOP workflow and notify user

### If Phase 4 review finds BLOCKING issues:

1. Document BLOCKING issues in .claude/context/reports/blockers.md
2. Planner marks plan as BLOCKED
3. STOP workflow
4. Notify user with blocker details and recommended actions
5. Do NOT proceed to Phase 6

### If Phase 5 consolidation finds conflicts:

1. Document conflicts in .claude/context/reports/conflicts.md
2. Attempt automatic resolution if possible
3. If manual resolution needed, pause workflow
4. Request user input for conflict resolution
5. Update plan with user decisions

### If Phase 6 integration fails:

1. **ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Delete partially copied files from target location
   - Revert CLAUDE.md changes (git restore)
   - Revert registry changes (git restore)
2. Document failure in issues.md
3. Preserve temp directory for debugging
4. Notify user with failure details
5. Provide rollback confirmation

### If Phase 8 verification fails:

1. **ROLLBACK INTEGRATION**:
   - Remove artifact from target location
   - Revert CLAUDE.md changes
   - Revert registry changes
2. Restore temp directory if cleaned up
3. Document verification failure in issues.md
4. Analyze failure cause
5. Update integration plan with fixes
6. Optionally re-run from Phase 6 with fixes

## Rollback Procedure (CRITICAL)

**When to rollback**: Phase 6 failure, Phase 8 verification failure, user request

**Rollback steps**:

```javascript

- **Security Review Workflow**: Phase 4 Security Review can be extracted as standalone workflow

## Customization Points

This workflow can be adapted for:

1. **Batch Integration**: Modify to handle multiple artifacts from single repository
2. **Upgrade Workflow**: Enhance Phase 0 to support in-place upgrades of existing artifacts
3. **Fork Integration**: Add phase to fork external repo before integration for customization
4. **Dependency Tree Integration**: Recursively integrate transitive dependencies

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Router spawning external-integration workflow
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Orchestrating external-integration workflow',
  prompt: `Execute external-integration workflow.

## Parameters
- Source: https://github.com/example/awesome-skill
- Artifact Type: skill
- Risk Level: medium

## Instructions
Follow the phased workflow in: .claude/workflows/core/external-integration.md

1. Start with Phase 0: Pre-Check
2. Proceed through phases sequentially
3. Spawn parallel agents in Phase 2 and Phase 4
4. Execute rollback if any phase fails
5. Verify integration in Phase 8

## Critical
- NEVER skip security review (Phase 4)
- ALWAYS isolate in temp directory first (Phase 1)
- ALWAYS update CLAUDE.md (Phase 6)
- ALWAYS verify before declaring success (Phase 8)
