# C4 Architecture Documentation Workflow

Generate comprehensive C4 architecture documentation for an existing repository/codebase using a bottom-up analysis approach.

## Overview

This workflow creates comprehensive C4 architecture documentation following the [official C4 model](https://c4model.com/diagrams) by:

1. **Code Level**: Analyzing every subdirectory bottom-up to create code-level documentation
2. **Component Level**: Synthesizing code documentation into logical components within containers
3. **Container Level**: Mapping components to deployment containers with API documentation (shows high-level technology choices)
4. **Context Level**: Creating high-level system context with personas and user journeys (focuses on people and software systems, not technologies)

**Note**: According to the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/diagrams), you don't need to use all 4 levels of diagram - the system context and container diagrams are sufficient for most software development teams. This workflow generates all levels for completeness, but teams can choose which levels to use.

All documentation is written to a new `C4-Documentation/` directory in the repository root.

## Phase 1: Code-Level Documentation (Bottom-Up Analysis)

### 1.1 Discover All Subdirectories

- Use codebase search to identify all subdirectories in the repository
- Sort directories by depth (deepest first) for bottom-up processing
- Filter out common non-code directories (node_modules, .git, build, dist, etc.)
- Create list of directories to process

### 1.2 Process Each Directory (Bottom-Up)

For each directory, starting from the deepest:

- Spawn c4-code agent with Task tool
- Prompt template:

```
You are the C4-CODE agent. Read .claude/agents/specialized/c4-code.md

## Task
Analyze the code in directory: [directory_path]

## Instructions
Create comprehensive C4 Code-level documentation following this structure:

1. **Overview Section**:
   - Name: [Descriptive name for this code directory]
   - Description: [Short description of what this code does]
   - Location: [Link to actual directory path relative to repo root]
   - Language: [Primary programming language(s) used]
   - Purpose: [What this code accomplishes]

2. **Code Elements Section**:
   - Document all functions/methods with complete signatures:
     - Function name, parameters (with types), return type
     - Description of what each function does
     - Location (file path and line numbers)
     - Dependencies (what this function depends on)
   - Document all classes/modules:
     - Class name, description, location
     - Methods and their signatures
     - Dependencies

3. **Dependencies Section**:
   - Internal dependencies (other code in this repo)
   - External dependencies (libraries, frameworks, services)

4. **Relationships Section**:
   - Optional Mermaid diagram if relationships are complex

Save the output as: C4-Documentation/c4-code-[directory-name].md
Use a sanitized directory name (replace / with -, remove special chars) for the filename.

## Memory Protocol
1. Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md first
2. Record patterns to memory after completion
```

- Expected output: c4-code-<directory-name>.md file in C4-Documentation/
- Context: All files in the directory and its subdirectories

**Repeat for every subdirectory** until all directories have corresponding c4-code-*.md files.

## Phase 2: Component-Level Synthesis

### 2.1 Analyze All Code-Level Documentation

- Collect all c4-code-*.md files created in Phase 1
- Analyze code structure, dependencies, and relationships
- Identify logical component boundaries based on:
  - Domain boundaries (related business functionality)

  - Organizational boundaries (team ownership, if evident)

### 2.2 Create Component Documentation

For each identified component:

- Spawn c4-component agent with Task tool

## Output Structure

```
C4-Documentation/
├── c4-code-*.md              # Code-level docs (one per directory)
├── c4-component-*.md          # Component-level docs (one per component)
├── c4-component.md            # Master component index
├── c4-container.md            # Container-level docs
├── c4-context.md              # Context-level docs
└── apis/                      # API specifications
    ├── [container]-api.yaml   # OpenAPI specs for each container
    └── ...
```

## Coordination Notes

- **Bottom-up processing**: Process directories from deepest to shallowest
- **Incremental synthesis**: Each level builds on the previous level's documentation
- **Complete coverage**: Every directory must have code-level documentation before synthesis
- **Link consistency**: All documentation files link to each other appropriately
- **API documentation**: Container APIs must have OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Stakeholder-friendly**: Context documentation should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Use proper C4 Mermaid notation for all diagrams

## Example Usage

As a Router, you would coordinate this workflow like:

```javascript
// Phase 1: Discover directories and spawn c4-code agents
// (repeat for each directory)
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'C4 Code analysis for src/api',
  prompt: 'You are C4-CODE agent. Read .claude/agents/specialized/c4-code.md...',
});

// Phase 2: Spawn c4-component agent to synthesize
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'C4 Component synthesis',
  prompt: 'You are C4-COMPONENT agent. Read .claude/agents/specialized/c4-component.md...',
});

// Phase 3: Spawn c4-container agent
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'C4 Container mapping',
  prompt: 'You are C4-CONTAINER agent. Read .claude/agents/specialized/c4-container.md...',
});

// Phase 4: Spawn c4-context agent
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'C4 Context documentation',
  prompt: 'You are C4-CONTEXT agent. Read .claude/agents/specialized/c4-context.md...',
});
```

This workflow implements a complete C4 architecture documentation process following the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code) using a bottom-up approach.
