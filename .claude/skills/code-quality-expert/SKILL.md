</capabilities>

<instructions>
### code quality expert

### clean code

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers

- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names

- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments

- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility

- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure

- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation

- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance

- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing

- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control

- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names

### code quality and best practices

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Adhere to code quality and best practices.
- Apply relevant paradigms and principles.
- Use semantic naming and abstractions.

### code quality standards

When reviewing or writing code, apply the principles above consistently. Focus on:

- Readability over cleverness
- Consistency within the codebase
- Progressive improvement (leave code better than you found it)

</instructions>

<examples>
Example usage:
```
User: "Review this code for code-quality best practices"
Agent: [Analyzes code against consolidated guidelines and provides specific feedback]
```

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
