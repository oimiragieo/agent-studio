# SUPERPOWERS INTEGRATION PLAN

> **For Claude:** Use this plan to integrate high-value skills, patterns, and agents from the Superpowers codebase into agent-studio's .claude framework.

## Executive Summary

Integration of the superpowers codebase into agent-studio framework. Key integrations focus on:

1. **Iron Laws Pattern** - Enforceable rules with rationalization tables that prevent shortcuts
2. **Verification Gates** - Evidence-before-claims methodology
3. **Two-Stage Code Review** - Spec compliance THEN quality review
4. **Systematic Debugging** - 4-phase root cause investigation
5. **Skill Writing Framework** - TDD-for-documentation methodology

**Source:** `C:\dev\projects\agent-studio\.claude.archive\.tmp\superpowers-main`
**Target:** `C:\dev\projects\agent-studio\.claude`
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours total

## 1. HIGH-VALUE INTEGRATIONS

### Tier 1: Critical (Must Have)

| Item | Reason | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| `test-driven-development` skill | Far more comprehensive than existing `tdd` skill - includes Iron Laws, rationalization prevention tables, red flags, and testing anti-patterns reference | P0 |
| `systematic-debugging` skill | More rigorous than existing `debugging` skill - 4-phase process with root-cause-tracing and defense-in-depth techniques | P0 |
| `verification-before-completion` skill | Unique capability - prevents false completion claims with "Evidence before claims" protocol | P0 |
| `code-reviewer` agent | Two-stage review (spec compliance then code quality) is a unique pattern not present in existing framework | P0 |

### Tier 2: High Value (Should Have)

| Item | Reason | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| `brainstorming` skill | Structured design refinement before implementation - prevents "Description Trap" | P1 |
| `writing-plans` skill | Bite-sized task creation (2-5 min tasks) with complete code snippets | P1 |
| `executing-plans` skill | Batch execution with review checkpoints | P1 |
| `subagent-driven-development` skill | Same-session plan execution with two-stage review per task | P1 |
| Slash commands (`/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, `/execute-plan`) | User-facing workflow triggers | P1 |

### Tier 3: Valuable (Nice to Have)

| Item | Reason | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| `using-git-worktrees` skill | Isolated workspace creation with safety verification | P2 |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` skill | Structured merge/PR decision workflow | P2 |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill | Concurrent subagent coordination pattern | P2 |
| `requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review` skills | Code review protocol skills | P2 |
| `writing-skills` skill | TDD applied to skill documentation creation | P2 |
| `using-superpowers` skill | Skill discovery and invocation introduction | P2 |
| Session-start hook | Automatic skill awareness injection | P2 |
| `skills-core.js` library | Skill discovery/parsing utilities | P3 |
| `find-polluter.sh` tool | Test pollution bisection finder | P3 |

---

## 2. OVERLAP ANALYSIS

### Skills Requiring Replacement (Superpowers version is superior)

| Existing Skill | Superpowers Skill | Action |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| `.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md` | `test-driven-development` | **REPLACE** - Superpowers version includes Iron Laws, red flags, rationalization tables, DOT flowcharts, testing anti-patterns reference |
| `.claude/skills/debugging/SKILL.md` | `systematic-debugging` | **REPLACE** - Superpowers version includes 4-phase process, root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, find-polluter tool |

### Skills That Complement (No Conflict)

| Existing Skill | Relationship |
|----------------|--------------|
| `.claude/skills/smart-debug/SKILL.md` | **KEEP** - Focuses on observability/production debugging. Superpowers `systematic-debugging` focuses on methodology. They complement each other. |
| `.claude/agents/core/qa.md` | **KEEP** - QA agent focuses on test coverage and regression. Code-reviewer agent focuses on plan compliance and code quality. Different purposes. |

## APPENDIX A: KEY PATTERNS TO ADOPT

### Pattern 1: Iron Laws

The Iron Laws pattern is the most valuable innovation. It defines an inviolable rule with explicit loophole closures:

```markdown
## The Iron Law

\`\`\`
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
\`\`\`

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.
```

This pattern should be applied to:
- TDD skill (already has it in Superpowers)
- Verification-before-completion skill
- Any discipline-enforcing skill

### Pattern 2: Rationalization Tables

Anticipate and counter agent rationalizations with explicit tables:

```markdown
## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |
| "TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic" | TDD IS pragmatic. Finds bugs before commit. |
```

### Pattern 3: Red Flags Lists

Provide self-check triggers that force agents to STOP:

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- Tests added "later"
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "I already manually tested it"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

### Pattern 4: The Gate Function

Verification-before-completion uses a gate function pattern:

```markdown
## The Gate Function

\`\`\`
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
\`\`\`
```

### Pattern 5: Two-Stage Code Review

Separates concerns for better quality:

1. **Spec Compliance Review** - Did they build what was requested?
   - Check for missing requirements
   - Check for extra/unneeded work
   - Check for misunderstandings
   - Verify by reading code, not trusting report

2. **Code Quality Review** - Is it well-built?
   - Clean architecture
   - Proper error handling
   - Type safety
   - Test quality

The key insight: spec compliance must pass BEFORE code quality review.

### Pattern 6: Spirit vs Letter Principle

Preemptively close the "spirit of the rule" loophole:

```markdown
**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**
```

This single line prevents agents from rationalizing violations by claiming they're "following the spirit."

## APPENDIX B: ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS

### YAML Frontmatter Conversion

Superpowers skills use minimal frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Use when...
---
```

Agent-studio skills use extended frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Description text
version: 1.0
model: sonnet
invoked_by: both
user_invocable: true
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
best_practices:
  - Practice 1
  - Practice 2
error_handling: graceful
streaming: supported
---
```

**Action:** Add agent-studio extended fields to all imported skills.

### Memory Protocol Addition

Every imported skill MUST include the Memory Protocol section at the end:

```markdown
## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**
\`\`\`bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
\`\`\`

**After completing:**
- New pattern -> `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md`
- Issue found -> `.claude/context/memory/issues.md`
- Decision made -> `.claude/context/memory/decisions.md`

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
```

### Cross-Reference Updates

Replace all Superpowers skill references:

| Superpowers Reference | Agent-Studio Reference |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | `tdd` |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | `debugging` |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | `verification-before-completion` |
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | `brainstorming` |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | `writing-plans` |
| `superpowers:executing-plans` | `executing-plans` |
| `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | `subagent-driven-development` |
| `superpowers:code-reviewer` | `code-reviewer` |
| `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` | `using-git-worktrees` |
| `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | `finishing-a-development-branch` |
