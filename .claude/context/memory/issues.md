## [TOOL-001] Tool Availability Documentation Drift (HIGH) 🔴 OPEN

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Category**: documentation_drift
- **Discovery**: Task #4 Tool Availability Audit
- **Description**: Two tool availability mismatches identified:
  1. **Sequential Thinking MCP Tool**: Referenced in 11 agent definitions + 1 skill but no MCP server configured in settings.json (mcpServers: {})
  2. **reflection-agent Bash Tool**: Frontmatter includes Bash but workflow section explicitly prohibits it
- **Root Cause**:
  - CLAUDE.md spawn templates were corrected (removed mcp tool via Task #1/Task #2) but agent definitions not updated
  - Agent frontmatter doesn't validate tool availability against actual system capabilities
  - No pre-spawn validation hook to check if requested tools exist
- **Impact**:
  - Agents fail at runtime with "No such tool available" errors
  - Time wasted debugging tool errors (estimated 3 hours in past incidents)
  - Confusion between what tools are documented vs. what's actually available
- **Affected Files**:
  - 11 agents with `mcp__sequential-thinking__*` wildcard
  - 1 skill with specific mcp tool reference
  - reflection-agent.md with Bash contradiction
- **Workaround**: Manual removal of MCP tool references from agent definitions
- **Permanent Fix**:
  1. Remove mcp\_\_ references from 11 agents + 1 skill (14 files total)
  2. Create tool-availability-validator.cjs pre-spawn hook
  3. Add documentation sync checker to CI
  4. Update agent definition schema to validate tools
- **Files to Modify**: See `.claude/context/plans/tool-availability-audit-2026-01-28.md` for full list
- **Related**:
  - Task #1, #2 (CLAUDE.md spawn template conflicting updates)
  - reflection-queue.jsonl entries showing MCP tool add/remove history

## [META-001] validate-integration.cjs Not Documented in CLAUDE.md (HIGH) ✅ RESOLVED

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: RESOLVED (2026-01-28)
- **Category**: ironic_invisible_artifact
- **Discovery**: Task #30 Meta-Reflection
- **Description**: The `validate-integration.cjs` CLI tool was created to prevent "invisible artifacts" but is itself undocumented in CLAUDE.md Section 9.6 (tools/cli/). This is an ironic instance of the very problem it was designed to solve.
- **Impact**: Users/agents may not discover the validation tool, defeating its purpose.
- **Resolution**: Added validate-integration.cjs (and 4 other CLI tools) to CLAUDE.md Section 9.6 tools/cli/ listing. Now discoverable in routing documentation.
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Verification**: `grep "validate-integration" .claude/CLAUDE.md` returns match
- **Prevention for Future**: Run validate-integration.cjs on itself during evolution

---

## [META-002] post-creation-reminder.cjs Hook Matcher Too Broad (MEDIUM) ✅ RESOLVED

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED (2026-01-28)
- **Category**: performance
- **Discovery**: Task #30 Meta-Reflection
- **Description**: The post-creation-reminder.cjs hook is registered with an empty matcher (`"matcher": ""`), causing it to run on EVERY user prompt, not just session start. This adds overhead and may produce redundant reminders.
- **Impact**: Performance overhead, potentially annoying redundant output
- **Resolution**: Implemented Option B - Added session detection logic inside hook using timestamp-based throttling. Hook now only runs once every 4 hours (writes timestamp to `.claude/.tmp/post-creation-reminder-last-run.txt`). This reduces overhead from every prompt to ~6x per day max.
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/hooks/session/post-creation-reminder.cjs`
- **Functions Added**: `hasRunRecently()`, `recordRun()`
- **Prevention for Future**: Review hook matchers during evolution Enable phase

## [META-003] Evolution State Completion Record Missing (LOW)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Category**: audit_trail
- **Discovery**: Task #30 Meta-Reflection
- **Description**: Task #29 evolution (post-creation-validation) completed all EVOLVE phases but the evolution-state.json may not have a proper completion entry in the `evolutions` array.
- **Impact**: Audit trail incomplete, harder to track evolution history
- **Time to Fix**: 15 minutes
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Add completion entry to evolution-state.json:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "workflow",
       "name": "post-creation-validation",
       "path": ".claude/workflows/core/post-creation-validation.md",
       "completedAt": "2026-01-28T...",
       "artifacts": [...]
     }
     ```
- **Prevention for Future**: Add evolution-state update verification to Phase E checklist

## [PROC-007] Router Violated Protocol During Meta-Reflection Implementation (HIGH)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: RESOLVED (changes kept, violation documented)
- **Category**: process_violation
- **Discovery**: User caught Router using Edit/Write directly
- **Description**: After Task #30 (meta-reflection) completed, Router directly implemented 3 HIGH priority fixes (REC-001, REC-002, REC-003) using Edit/Write tools instead of spawning a developer agent. This violated Section 1.1 ROUTER TOOL RESTRICTIONS.
- **Violations**:
  - Used Edit (5 times): CLAUDE.md, hooks, settings.json, issues.md
  - Used Write (1 time): pre-completion-validation.cjs
  - Bypassed Gate 3 (Tool Check)
  - Should have spawned developer agent via Task() tool
- **Root Cause**: Router misinterpreted user's "continue" as permission to implement directly, bypassed self-check gates
- **Why Enforcement Failed**:
  - routing-guard.cjs may have seen stale state (taskSpawned: true from Task #30)
  - OR was in "warn" mode (warning missed)
  - OR failed-open due to error
- **Work Done (correct but wrong process)**:
  1. Added validate-integration.cjs to CLAUDE.md Section 9.6
  2. Created pre-completion-validation.cjs hook (blocks invalid task completions)
  3. Fixed post-creation-reminder.cjs throttling (4-hour window)
  4. Updated settings.json (registered pre-completion hook)
  5. Updated issues.md (resolved META-001, META-002)
- **Impact**: Protocol violation sets bad precedent, weakens router discipline
- **Resolution**: Changes kept (correct and needed), violation documented, enforcement to be strengthened
- **Files Modified**: 5 files (CLAUDE.md, post-creation-reminder.cjs, pre-completion-validation.cjs, settings.json, issues.md)
- **Prevention for Future**:
  1. Strengthen router-state tracking (clear on every user prompt)
  2. Add explicit "continue" handling (always means "spawn agent", never "implement")
  3. Review routing-guard.cjs state-based bypass logic
  4. Add ROUTER_DEBUG logging for enforcement decisions

## [INTEGRATION-001] Routing Table Integration Gap - "Invisible Artifact" Pattern (CRITICAL)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: process_gap
- **Discovery**: BMAD-METHOD Integration Session Reflection (Task #28)
- **Description**: Party Mode was fully implemented (145 tests, 5 documentation guides, 6 security controls validated) but was NOT added to CLAUDE.md Section 3 routing table. This made the feature "invisible" to the router - users could not invoke Party Mode via natural language.
- **Root Cause Analysis** (5 Whys):
  1. Why wasn't it added? Focus on implementation, neglected routing registration
  2. Why was registration neglected? No explicit step in party-orchestrator creation workflow
  3. Why no explicit step? Creator workflows assume manual registration
  4. Why assume manual? Historical pattern, no automation for routing table updates
  5. Why no automation? Not identified as a risk until this incident
- **Impact**: Feature exists but is unusable - router cannot route users to party-orchestrator
- **Time to Fix**: 5 minutes (add one line to CLAUDE.md routing table)
- **Time to Debug (without fix)**: Potentially hours of "why doesn't Party Mode work?" investigation
- **Resolution**:
  1. Added `| Multi-agent collaboration | party-orchestrator | .claude/agents/orchestrators/party-orchestrator.md |` to CLAUDE.md Section 3
  2. Documented "Invisible Artifact" anti-pattern in learnings.md
  3. Created post-creation integration checklist
  4. Recommended `validate-integration.cjs` tooling for future prevention
- **Prevention for Future**:
  1. Add "Routing Table Integration" as IRON LAW step in all creator workflows
  2. Create `validate-integration.cjs` script that checks routing table completeness
  3. Add integration test: "All agents in agents/ directory have routing entries"
  4. Include post-creation checklist in agent-creator, skill-creator, hook-creator skills
- **Related Issues**: WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001, ENFORCEMENT-001
- **Reflection Report**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/bmad-method-integration-reflection-20260128.md`

## [TEST-API-001] Test API Mismatch Pattern - Tests Against Planned vs Actual API (HIGH)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: RESOLVED (Pattern Documented)
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: process_gap
- **Discovery**: BMAD-METHOD Integration Session Reflection (Task #28)
- **Description**: Phase 5 QA tests were written against the PLANNED API (from implementation plan) instead of the ACTUAL API (Phase 1-4 module exports). This resulted in 48% test failure rate (18/38 tests failing).
- **Specific Mismatches**:
  - `buildConsensus()` planned → `aggregateResponses()` actual (different signature)
  - `verifyAgentIdentity()` planned → not implemented (function missing)
  - `validateTeamMember()` planned → `validateTeamDefinition()` actual (different name)
  - `enforceRateLimits(sessionState, agentIds)` planned → different signature actual
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. Implementation plan was detailed and seemed authoritative
  2. QA agent wrote tests without checking actual exports
  3. Bulk test writing (all 38 tests before any execution)
  4. No reconciliation step between plan and implementation
- **Impact**: 48% test failure rate, 3 hours estimated rework, wasted 6-8 hours writing wrong tests
- **Resolution**:
  1. Documented "Test Against Planned API" anti-pattern in learnings.md
  2. Added MANDATORY verification step: Check actual module exports before writing tests
  3. Created pattern for single test verification before bulk testing
  4. Recommended `verify-api.cjs` tooling for plan vs implementation comparison
- **Prevention for Future**:
  1. **MANDATORY**: Check actual exports: `node -e "console.log(Object.keys(require('./module.cjs')).join(', '))"`
  2. Write ONE passing test first to verify imports
  3. Update implementation plan when scope changes during development
  4. Generate API reference doc after implementation, before testing

## [ENFORCEMENT-003] Router-First Protocol Is Advisory-Only, Not Blocking (CRITICAL)

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: enforcement_gap
- **Description**: All routing hooks (user-prompt-unified.cjs, routing-guard.cjs, skill-creation-guard.cjs) exit with code 0 (allow) in ALL cases. This means the Router-First Protocol is a DOCUMENTATION-ONLY CONVENTION, not a technically enforced constraint. Claude can bypass the protocol at will because no hook actually blocks tool usage without prior Task spawn.
- **Root Cause Analysis** (Updated 2026-01-28): The original diagnosis was INCORRECT. The hooks WERE correctly designed to exit with code 2 for blocking. The actual issue was state management - ROUTING-002 and ROUTING-003 caused `taskSpawned` to incorrectly remain `true` from previous sessions, bypassing the blocking logic. The ROUTING-002/003 fixes resolved the root cause.
- **Resolution**:
  1. VERIFIED: routing-guard.cjs line 711 ALREADY exits with code 2 when blocking
  2. VERIFIED: checkRouterSelfCheck() ALREADY returns `{ pass: false, result: 'block' }` for blacklisted tools
  3. CONFIRMED: ROUTING-002 and ROUTING-003 fixes addressed the state management issues
  4. ADDED: 7 new comprehensive integration tests in routing-guard.test.cjs proving end-to-end blocking works
  5. TEST PROOF: Hook exits with code 2 when Router uses Glob/Grep/WebSearch/Edit/Write in router mode
- **Tests Added** (Task #4 - ENFORCEMENT-003 fix verification):
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook should exit with code 2 when blocking Glob in router mode
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook should exit with code 0 when allowing Read tool
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook should exit with code 2 when blocking Write in router mode
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook should exit with code 0 when enforcement is off
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook blocking message should indicate spawn requirement
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Hook should block WebSearch in router mode
  - ENFORCEMENT-003: Comprehensive blacklist test - all blacklisted tools should be blocked
- **Test Results**: 83 tests pass (up from 76)
- **Related Issues**: ENFORCEMENT-001, ENFORCEMENT-002, WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001, ROUTING-002 (RESOLVED), ROUTING-003 (RESOLVED)
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/hooks/routing/routing-guard.test.cjs` (added 7 integration tests)

## [TESTING-003] Claude Command Blocked by bash-command-validator

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: testing_blocker
- **Task**: Task #4 - Fix TESTING-003
- **Description**: The bash-command-validator.cjs hook blocks the `claude` command itself, preventing headless testing of the framework. Attempting to run `claude --version` or `claude -p "prompt"` returns SEC-AUDIT-017 error: "Unregistered command 'claude'".
- **Root Cause**: SEC-AUDIT-017 security hardening implemented deny-by-default for unregistered commands. The `claude` CLI was never added to the validator's COMMAND_VALIDATORS registry.
- **Resolution**: The `claude` command was already added to `SAFE_COMMANDS_ALLOWLIST` in `.claude/hooks/safety/validators/registry.cjs` (line 159) with comment "Framework self-testing (Claude CLI for headless tests)". Verification confirmed the command is present and allowlisted. No additional changes needed - the fix was implemented prior to this task.
- **Verification**: Checked `registry.cjs` lines 112-182, found `'claude'` at line 159 in `SAFE_COMMANDS_ALLOWLIST` array.
- **Files Verified**: `.claude/hooks/safety/validators/registry.cjs`
- **Report**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/router-tests-2026-01-27.md`
- **Related Issues**: SEC-AUDIT-017 (validator deny-by-default implementation)

## Reflection Agent Findings - Skill Creation Workflow (2026-01-27)

### [WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001] Router Bypassing Skill-Creator Workflow

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: routing_violation
- **Description**: Router attempted to create ripgrep skill by directly copying archived files and writing SKILL.md manually, bypassing the entire skill-creator workflow. This skipped ALL mandatory post-creation steps: CLAUDE.md update, skill catalog update, agent assignment, validation, and memory update. The skill would have been invisible to Router and unusable by agents.
- **Root Cause**: Optimization bias - Router perceived workflow as "unnecessary overhead" when archived files existed. This is a systems thinking failure where shortcuts are prioritized over process compliance.
- **Detection**: User intervention caught the violation. No automated safeguards exist.
- **Impact**:
  - Skill not in CLAUDE.md → Invisible to Router
  - Skill not in catalog → Hard to discover
  - Skill not assigned to agents → Never invoked
  - No validation → Broken references undetected
- **Resolution** (All 5 remediation steps completed):
  1. Gate 4 in router-decision.md - DONE (Question 5, lines 255-282)
  2. CLAUDE.md IRON LAW language - DONE (Section 1.2 Gate 4, line 92)
  3. Hook for direct SKILL.md writes - DONE (unified-creator-guard.cjs)
  4. ASCII box warning in skill-creator - DONE (27-line warning added)
  5. Anti-pattern in training examples - DONE (lines 490-550)
- **Enforcement**: unified-creator-guard.cjs blocks direct writes to .claude/skills/\*\*/SKILL.md
- **Related Issues**: ROUTER-VIOLATION-001 (resolved), DOC-001 (pointer gaps), ENFORCEMENT-001 (RESOLVED)
- **Reflection Score**: Iteration 1: 4.6/10 (Critical Fail), Iteration 2: 9.8/10 (Excellent after correction)

### [ENFORCEMENT-001] No Hook to Prevent Direct SKILL.md Writes

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: enforcement_gap
- **Description**: No enforcement hook exists to prevent Router from writing SKILL.md files directly without invoking skill-creator. This allows workflow bypasses that create invisible skills.
- **Root Cause**: Safety hooks focus on security (path traversal, Windows reserved names) but not workflow compliance.
- **Detection**: Manual review during reflection discovered the gap.
- **Resolution** (verified 2026-01-28):
  1. **unified-creator-guard.cjs** ALREADY implements all requirements:
     - Blocks Write/Edit tools for `/skills/*/SKILL.md` paths (pattern at line 60-64)
     - Checks if skill-creator was invoked via `isCreatorActive('skill-creator')` (line 342)
     - Returns BLOCKING error with code 2 when not invoked (line 351-352, 423)
     - Generates clear violation message explaining how to fix (lines 271-298)
  2. **skill-invocation-tracker.cjs** tracks skill-creator invocation:
     - Registered in settings.json (lines 104-108)
     - Triggers on PreToolUse(Skill)
     - Calls `markCreatorActive('skill-creator')` when skill-creator is invoked
     - Writes to `.claude/context/runtime/active-creators.json`
  3. **Both hooks registered** in settings.json:
     - unified-creator-guard.cjs on Edit|Write (line 59)
     - skill-invocation-tracker.cjs on Skill (line 107)
  4. **Comprehensive tests**: 43 tests in unified-creator-guard.test.cjs, 19 tests in skill-invocation-tracker.test.cjs
  5. **SEC-REMEDIATION-001**: TTL reduced from 10 to 3 minutes for security hardening
- **Verification** (2026-01-28):
  - 43/43 unified-creator-guard tests pass
  - 19/19 skill-invocation-tracker tests pass
  - Integration tests verify tracker -> guard coordination (4 tests)
  - ENFORCEMENT-002 tests verify same state file and TTL constants
- **Files**:
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/unified-creator-guard.cjs` (488 lines)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/skill-invocation-tracker.cjs` (189 lines)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/unified-creator-guard.test.cjs` (661 lines, 43 tests)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/skill-invocation-tracker.test.cjs` (175 lines, 19 tests)
- **Related Issues**: WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001, ENFORCEMENT-002 (RESOLVED)

### [ENFORCEMENT-002] skill-creation-guard State Tracking Not Implemented (CRITICAL)

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: enforcement_gap
- **Description**: Security audit claimed that `skill-creation-guard.cjs` state tracking was non-functional. Investigation revealed this was a MISDIAGNOSIS - the mechanism was already working.
- **Actual State** (verified 2026-01-28):
  1. `skill-invocation-tracker.cjs` WAS already registered in settings.json (lines 104-108)
  2. `markCreatorActive()` WAS being called via the PreToolUse hook
  3. `active-creators.json` state file WAS being created correctly
  4. The deprecated `skill-creation-guard.cjs` was replaced by `unified-creator-guard.cjs`
- **Root Cause of Misdiagnosis**: Original audit looked at deprecated file paths and didn't verify the unified implementation
- **Changes Made**:
  1. SEC-REMEDIATION-001: Reduced TTL from 10 to 3 minutes (security hardening)
  2. Added 4 integration tests verifying tracker↔guard coordination
  3. Updated TTL test to verify 3-minute constant
- **Tests Added**: 5 new tests (4 integration + 1 SEC-REMEDIATION)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `unified-creator-guard.cjs` (TTL change)
  - `skill-invocation-tracker.cjs` (TTL change)
  - `unified-creator-guard.test.cjs` (integration tests)
  - `skill-invocation-tracker.test.cjs` (TTL test)
- **Test Results**: 62/62 tests pass
- **Related Issues**: ENFORCEMENT-001 (RESOLVED), WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001, SEC-REMEDIATION-001 (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)
- **Audit Report**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/router-protocol-audit-2026-01-27.md`
- **Security Review**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/remediation-security-review-2026-01-27.md`

### [SEC-REMEDIATION-001] State File Tampering Risk (HIGH)

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Category**: security_gap
- **Description**: Security review of ENFORCEMENT-002 remediation identified that the proposed state file (`active-creators.json`) can be tampered with by an attacker to bypass the skill-creation-guard. Attack vectors include:
  1. Pre-emptive state file creation before SKILL.md write
  2. Time window exploitation (10-minute window is generous)
  3. State file persistence (no automatic cleanup on failures)
- **Root Cause**: State file relies on writable JSON with no integrity verification
- **Detection**: Security-Architect parallel review (Task #3 remediation) 2026-01-27
- **Impact**: Attacker with file system access can bypass skill-creation-guard entirely
- **Remediation Progress** (2026-01-28):
  - [DONE] Reduce time window from 10 minutes to 3 minutes (implemented in both hooks)
  - [DEFERRED] Implement HMAC signature verification (complex, low ROI for framework)
  - [DEFERRED] Add automatic state file cleanup on TTL expiration (isCreatorActive already handles)
- **Effort Estimate**: Remaining work deferred (HMAC would be 4+ hours for low value)
- **Related Issues**: ENFORCEMENT-002 (RESOLVED)
- **Security Review**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/remediation-security-review-2026-01-27.md`

### [SEC-REMEDIATION-002] bashPath Null Byte Injection (MEDIUM)

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: security_gap
- **Description**: The proposed `bashPath()` utility in `platform.cjs` lacks null byte sanitization. Null bytes (\0) are a common command injection vector that could be used to truncate paths or bypass validation.
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete input sanitization in proposed implementation
- **Detection**: Security-Architect parallel review (Task #3 remediation) 2026-01-27
- **Impact**: Potential path injection via null bytes
- **Resolution**: Added null byte sanitization (`filepath.replace(/\0/g, '')`) to bashPath() function in platform.cjs. Added input type validation for non-string types. Added conditional debug logging for shell metacharacters when PLATFORM_DEBUG=true. Added 3 new tests for null byte handling.
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/lib/utils/platform.cjs`, `.claude/lib/utils/platform.test.cjs`
- **Tests**: 35/35 pass (added 3 new tests for null byte sanitization)
- **Related Issues**: Windows Bash Path Handling Pattern (learnings.md)
- **Security Review**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/remediation-security-review-2026-01-27.md`

### [SEC-REMEDIATION-003] Researcher Agent Data Exfiltration Risk (MEDIUM)

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED (Documentation)
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: security_gap
- **Description**: Researcher agent has WebFetch capability without URL allowlist. A malicious prompt could instruct the agent to read sensitive files and POST them to attacker-controlled URLs.
- **Root Cause**: No URL domain allowlist for WebFetch in research context
- **Detection**: Security-Architect parallel review (Task #3 remediation) 2026-01-27
- **Impact**: Potential data exfiltration via WebFetch
- **Resolution** (Documentation-only approach implemented):
  1. **URL Domain Allowlist**: Added trusted domains table to researcher.md (Research APIs, Documentation, Package Registries, Academic, Standards, Developer Resources)
  2. **Blocked Targets**: Documented RFC 1918 private networks, localhost, internal domains, cloud metadata endpoints
  3. **Rate Limiting Guidance**: Documented 20 requests/minute limit
  4. **Write/Edit Tools Excluded**: Verified tools list does NOT include Write/Edit (line 10 comment: "READ-ONLY - no Write/Edit for security")
  5. **Security Constraints Section**: Added comprehensive "Security Constraints (SEC-REMEDIATION-003)" section (lines 60-99) explaining:
     - URL Domain Allowlist with categorized trusted domains
     - Blocked Targets with specific patterns
     - Data Handling Rules (no exfiltration, no credentials, no file uploads)
     - Why No Write/Edit Tools explanation (attack scenario documented)
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/agents/specialized/researcher.md`
- **Verification**: Task #17 verified all security constraints are in place
- **Note**: This is a documentation-based mitigation. A future hook-based enforcement (url-allowlist-guard.cjs) could provide runtime blocking but was deemed unnecessary given:
  - Researcher lacks Write/Edit tools (cannot create malicious outbound files)
  - WebFetch is read-only (HTTP GET, not POST capability)
  - Documentation provides clear guidelines for agent behavior
- **Related Issues**: ADR-037 MCP Tool Access Control
- **Security Review**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/remediation-security-review-2026-01-27.md`

### [DOC-002] CLAUDE.md Section 7 Lacks Visceral Workflow Emphasis

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: documentation_gap
- **Description**: CLAUDE.md Section 7 (Skill Invocation Protocol) mentions "invoke skill-creator" but doesn't emphasize the BLOCKING nature of post-creation steps. Router interpreted workflow as optional overhead.
- **Root Cause**: Documentation doesn't convey that post-creation steps ARE the value, not just bureaucracy.
- **Resolution**: Added "IRON LAW: NO ARTIFACT CREATION WITHOUT CREATOR" subsection to CLAUDE.md Section 7 (lines 744-809). The section includes:
  1. ASCII art warning box with CREATOR WORKFLOW IRON LAW (lines 746-771)
  2. Visceral language: "INVISIBLE", "NEVER discovered", "NEVER invoked"
  3. Before/After violation examples with WRONG/CORRECT patterns (lines 773-799)
  4. Explanation of WHY workflow matters (discoverability, integration, validation)
  5. Post-creation steps enforcement list (lines 801-807)
  6. Enforcement note about unified-creator-guard.cjs (line 768, 809)
- **Files Modified**: (Section 7, lines 744-809)
- **Related Issues**: WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001

### [DOC-003] Router Training Examples Missing Skill Creation Anti-Pattern

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: documentation_gap
- **Description**: `.claude/docs/ROUTER_TRAINING_EXAMPLES.md` doesn't include "Skill Creation Shortcut" anti-pattern. Router needs explicit training that shortcuts are harmful.
- **Resolution**: Added "Anti-Pattern 1: Skill Creation Shortcut" section to ROUTER_TRAINING_EXAMPLES.md. Shows WRONG reasoning (copying archived files), explains why it's wrong (invisible skills), and demonstrates CORRECT reasoning (invoke skill-creator workflow). Includes enforcement note about unified-creator-guard.cjs.
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/docs/ROUTER_TRAINING_EXAMPLES.md`
- **Related Issues**: WORKFLOW-VIOLATION-001, DOC-002

## Architecture Review Findings (2026-01-27)

### POINTER GAPS

### POINTER-001: Empty Diagrams Directory Despite Agent References

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: pointer_gap
- **Impact**: silent_failure
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Description**: Architect agent references `.claude/context/artifacts/diagrams/` for diagram output (architect.md line 78). The diagram-generator skill exists and is invoked, but the directory contains only .gitkeep placeholders - zero actual diagrams have been generated.
- **Resolution**: Verification on 2026-01-28 (Task #10) found the issue was already resolved. The directory contains 5 comprehensive Mermaid architecture diagrams and a README.md:
  1. `01-system-architecture.md` - High-level component relationships
  2. `02-agent-hierarchy.md` - Agent organization and routing
  3. `03-hook-system-flow.md` - Hook lifecycle and categories
  4. `04-skill-invocation-flow.md` - How agents discover and use skills
  5. `05-evolve-state-machine.md` - Self-evolution workflow phases
  6. `README.md` - Diagram index with viewing instructions
- **Original Remediation** (now complete):
  1. Create example architecture diagrams for the framework itself (agents, hooks, workflows structure) - DONE
  2. Update FILE_PLACEMENT_RULES.md with explicit diagram placement rules - NOT NEEDED (README covers usage)
  3. Add diagram generation to evolution-orchestrator workflow as evidence of architectural decisions - DEFERRED

### POINTER-003: Architect Missing Workflow References

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: pointer_gap
- **Impact**: maintainability
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Description**: Architect agent definition mentions "trade-off analysis using SequentialThinking" (line 56) but provides NO guidance on which workflows to use for architecture reviews. The framework HAS architecture-review-skill-workflow.md, consensus-voting-skill-workflow.md, and database-architect-skill-workflow.md, but architect.md doesn't reference them.
- **Resolution**: Verified that architect.md already contains "Related Workflows" section (lines 127-134) with references to all three workflows:
  - architecture-review-skill-workflow.md
  - consensus-voting-skill-workflow.md (for multi-agent decisions)
  - database-architect-skill-workflow.md
- **Verification**: Confirmed all three workflow files exist in `.claude/workflows/` directory

### STRUCTURAL ISSUES

### ARCH-002: Consolidated Hook File Confusion Risk

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: structural
- **Impact**: maintainability
- **Status**: Documented (Recommendation)
- **Description**: Per ADR-026, individual hooks (planner-first-guard.cjs, task-create-guard.cjs, router-self-check.cjs, security-review-guard.cjs, router-write-guard.cjs) still exist as files but are NOT registered in settings.json. They were consolidated into routing-guard.cjs. Files kept for reference/testing, but could confuse future developers who might edit the wrong file.
- **Remediation**: Two options:
  1. **Preferred**: Move to `.claude/hooks/routing/_legacy/` subdirectory with README explaining consolidation
  2. **Alternative**: Add header comment to each file: `// NOT REGISTERED - See routing-guard.cjs for active implementation`

### ARCH-003: Skill Catalog Count Audit Needed

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: structural
- **Impact**: maintainability
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Description**: Skill catalog header claims "Total Skills: 426 (2 deprecated)" but category table totals need verification. The count includes 139 scientific sub-skills under scientific-skills parent.
- **Audit Results**:
  - **Top-level skill directories**: 288 (each with SKILL.md)
  - **Scientific sub-skills**: 142 (not 139 as originally claimed)
    - 139 directories in scientific-skills/skills/
    - Plus 4 SKILL.md files in document-skills/ (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx)
    - Minus 1 for document-skills directory itself (no parent SKILL.md)
    - Net: 139 + 4 - 1 = 142 sub-skills
  - **Total invocable skills**: 288 + 142 = 430
  - **Deprecated skills**: 2 (testing-expert, writing)
- **Discrepancies Found**:
  1. Header claimed 429, actual is 430 (off by 1)
  2. Scientific sub-skills claimed 139, actual is 142 (off by 3)
- **Resolution**: Updated skill-catalog.md:
  1. Header updated from "429 (2 deprecated)" to "430 (2 deprecated)"
  2. Scientific Research count updated from 139 to 142
  3. Last Updated date changed to 2026-01-28
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/context/artifacts/skill-catalog.md`

### DOCUMENTATION GAPS

### DOC-001: Missing Skill-to-Workflow Cross-References

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: pointer_gap
- **Impact**: maintainability
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Description**: Skills like architecture-review, consensus-voting, database-architect had corresponding workflow files (.claude/workflows/\*-skill-workflow.md), but the skill files didn't reference the workflows and vice versa. This broke discoverability.
- **Resolution**: Added "Workflow Integration" sections to security-architect skill and chrome-browser skill, referencing their respective workflows. Updated workflows to cross-reference skills. This establishes bidirectional discoverability pattern for future skills with workflows.
- **Remediation**: Add "Workflow Integration" section to each skill that has a corresponding workflow

## Architecture Review Pointer Gaps (2026-01-26)

### [ARCH-002] Undocumented Skill Workflows

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 Enterprise Workflows table
- **Description**: 6 workflow files exist but are not documented in CLAUDE.md:
  - security-architect-skill-workflow.md
  - architecture-review-skill-workflow.md
  - consensus-voting-skill-workflow.md
  - swarm-coordination-skill-workflow.md
  - database-architect-skill-workflow.md
  - context-compressor-skill-workflow.md
- **Impact**: Agents may not discover these workflows
- **Resolution**: All 6 workflows were already added to CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 Enterprise Workflows table (lines 865-870). Verification confirmed all entries present with correct paths and descriptions.

### [ARCH-003] Inconsistent Workflow Placement - Won't Fix (Documented)

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: Won't Fix (Documented)
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/workflows/` directory
- **Description**: Skill workflows are inconsistently placed - most in root workflows/ but one in workflows/enterprise/
- **Resolution**: Created workflows/README.md documenting the organization pattern. All 7 skill-specific workflows ARE documented in CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 Enterprise Workflows table. Skills have "Related Workflow" sections pointing to workflow files. Current pattern (core/, enterprise/, operations/) is intentional. Moving files would require breaking changes. LOW priority issue does not justify reorganization.

### [ARCH-004] Deprecated Skill Reference in technical-writer.md

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **File**: `.claude/agents/core/technical-writer.md`
- **Description**: References deprecated `writing` skill instead of `writing-skills`
- **Impact**: Works due to alias but inconsistent with deprecation policy
- **Resolution**: Verified the skills list in technical-writer.md (lines 24-31) already contains only `writing-skills`. No deprecated `writing` reference exists. The original issue was either already fixed or was a false positive. All 7 occurrences of "writing" in the file refer to either `writing-skills` or are prose text describing writing guidelines.

## Library Code Quality Audit (2026-01-26)

### Important Issues for Next Sprint

**IMP-001: Missing JSDoc Documentation - RESOLVED**

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to 20+ exported functions across:
  - `memory-manager.cjs`: 10 functions (getMemoryDir, saveSession, recordGotcha, recordPattern, recordDiscovery, loadMemoryForContext, getMemoryHealth, readMemoryAsync, atomicWriteAsync, ensureDirAsync)
  - `memory-tiers.cjs`: 5 functions (getTierPath, writeSTMEntry, consolidateSession, promoteToLTM, getTierHealth)
  - `smart-pruner.cjs`: 4 functions (calculateUtility, pruneByUtility, deduplicateAndPrune, enforceRetention)
- Each JSDoc includes @param, @returns, @throws, and @example tags where applicable

**IMP-006: Missing Error Path Test Coverage - RESOLVED**

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive error path tests:
  - `memory-manager.test.cjs`: 14 new tests covering corrupted JSON (gotchas, patterns, codebase_map, sessions), missing directories, async error handling, pruneCodebaseMap edge cases
  - `memory-tiers.test.cjs`: 9 new tests covering corrupted STM/MTM files, missing STM in consolidateSession, session not found in promoteToLTM, empty/null inputs in generateSessionSummary, unknown tier in getTierPath, clearSTM with missing file
  - `smart-pruner.test.cjs`: 24 new tests covering null/undefined handling in all scoring functions, edge cases in deduplication and pruning
- Also fixed 2 bugs discovered through tests:
  - `getImportanceScore()` now handles null entries gracefully
  - `deduplicateAndPrune()` now handles null options gracefully
- All tests pass: memory-manager (44 tests), memory-tiers (24 tests), smart-pruner (53 tests)

**IMP-007: workflow-validator Missing Step Schema Validation - RESOLVED**

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Previous Issue**: Only validated phases, not step structure
- **Resolution**: Added validateStepSchema() and validateSingleStep() functions. Added 7 tests covering step validation. All 23 workflow-validator tests pass.

## Hook Code Quality Audit (2026-01-26)

### Important Issues (Should Fix)

**HOOK-001: Massive Code Duplication - parseHookInput() - RESOLVED**

- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Impact**: ~2000 lines duplicated across 40+ hooks
- **Resolution**:
  - Verified shared utility already exists at `.claude/lib/utils/hook-input.cjs` with comprehensive functionality
  - 44 hooks have been refactored to use the shared utility
  - Remaining hooks either: (a) don't need hook input parsing (SessionStart hooks), (b) are deprecated (session-end-recorder.cjs), or (c) are utility files not hooks
  - Refactored extract-workflow-learnings.cjs to use parseHookInputSync() (final remaining candidate)
  - Duplication eliminated: ~2000 lines saved across 44+ hooks
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/hooks/memory/extract-workflow-learnings.cjs`
- **Tests**: All 29 tests pass after refactoring

**HOOK-002: findProjectRoot() Duplication**

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Impact**: ~200 lines duplicated across 20+ hooks
- **Fix**: Use existing `.claude/lib/utils/project-root.cjs` or create if missing
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 hour
- **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED (2026-01-28)
- **Resolution Progress**:
  - 5 active files refactored to use shared PROJECT_ROOT:
    1. `.claude/hooks/safety/router-write-guard.test.cjs` - removed 12 lines
    2. `.claude/hooks/routing/router-enforcer.test.cjs` - removed 12 lines
    3. `.claude/hooks/routing/router-state.test.cjs` - removed 12 lines
    4. `.claude/hooks/routing/unified-creator-guard.test.cjs` - removed 12 lines
    5. `.claude/hooks/safety/file-placement-guard.cjs` - simplified function (13 lines -> 4 lines)
  - 2 deprecated files skipped (skill-creation-guard.cjs.deprecated, \_legacy/task-create-guard.test.cjs)
  - Total lines saved: ~49 lines across 5 files
  - All tests pass after refactoring
- **Remaining Work**: Other hooks outside .claude/hooks/ may still have duplication

**HOOK-004: State Cache Integration Incomplete**

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Files**: file-placement-guard.cjs, loop-prevention.cjs, research-enforcement.cjs
- **Issue**: evolution-state.json and loop-state.json read without caching
- **Impact**: ~40% redundant I/O on state files
- **Fix**: Add state-cache.cjs integration to getEvolutionState() and getLoopState()
- **Estimated Effort**: 4 hours
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Integrated state-cache.cjs into all three files:
  1. **file-placement-guard.cjs**: Updated `getEvolutionState()` to use `getCachedState()` with safe property extraction (no re-serialization overhead)
  2. **loop-prevention.cjs**: Updated `getState()` to use `getCachedState()`, added `invalidateCache()` after writes in `_saveState()`
  3. **research-enforcement.cjs**: Already had cache integration (verified)
  - Tests updated to call `invalidateCache()` after direct file writes
  - All tests pass: 129/129 file-placement-guard, 47/47 loop-prevention

**HOOK-006: Inconsistent Audit Logging Format - RESOLVED**

- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Files**: session-memory-extractor.cjs, multiple reflection hooks
- **Issue**: Some hooks use plain console.error, others use JSON.stringify
- **Impact**: Inconsistent log parsing for monitoring tools
- **Resolution**: Standardized 9 hooks to use auditLog() from shared utility. Updated 28 logging calls across all affected hooks. All hooks now follow consistent JSON format.
- **Effort**: 2 hours

### Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

**HOOK-007: Magic Numbers - Timeout Values - RESOLVED**

- **Files**: task-completion-reflection.cjs (L183), session-memory-extractor.cjs (L156), loop-prevention.cjs (L48)
- **Issue**: Hardcoded timeout values (100ms, 300000ms) without named constants
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Verified constants already extracted to module-level. Original files deprecated; loop-prevention.cjs has proper constants defined at top level with documentation.

**HOOK-008: Missing JSDoc on Exported Functions - RESOLVED**

- **Files**: Priority hooks (routing-guard, unified-creator-guard, loop-prevention, file-placement-guard, unified-evolution-guard)
- **Issue**: No JSDoc comments on module.exports functions
- **Impact**: Harder for developers to understand API
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive JSDoc to 5 priority hooks. Each now has proper @param, @returns, @throws documentation. Covers 90% of critical hook functions.

**HOOK-009: Inconsistent Module Exports - RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: 60% of hooks export for testing, 40% don't
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Standardized 6 hooks with module.exports. All 55 hooks now export main() for testing. Verified all hook test files pass (344 tests across all hooks).

### Test Coverage Gaps

**HOOK-TEST-001: session-memory-extractor.cjs Missing Tests**

- **File**: `.claude/hooks/memory/session-memory-extractor.cjs`
- **Current Coverage**: 46 tests (was 11, added 35 comprehensive tests)
- **Target**: 10+ tests covering extractPatterns, extractGotchas, extractDiscoveries
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive test coverage for all three extraction functions:
  - extractPatterns: 12 tests (pattern, approach, solution, technique, always, should, using X for Y, filters, edge cases)
  - extractGotchas: 12 tests (gotcha, pitfall, warning, caution, never, avoid, bug, fixed by, filters, edge cases)
  - extractDiscoveries: 12 tests (file, module, component, is/handles/contains/manages descriptions, filters, extensions)
  - Shared utilities: 3 tests (PROJECT_ROOT import, parseHookInputAsync import)
  - Edge cases: 5 tests (null/undefined, numeric input, long strings, unicode, newlines)
  - Combined extraction: 2 tests (complex output, real-world task output)
- **Test File**: `.claude/hooks/memory/session-memory-extractor.test.cjs`

**HOOK-TEST-002: Untested Routing Hooks**

- **Files**: agent-context-tracker.cjs, agent-context-pre-tracker.cjs, documentation-routing-guard.cjs
- **Impact**: 3/12 routing hooks untested (25% gap)
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Verified comprehensive test coverage exists for all three hooks:
  - agent-context-tracker.test.cjs: 30 tests (Task detection, PLANNER detection, SECURITY-ARCHITECT detection, state persistence, state accumulation, task description extraction, edge cases, debug output, exit behavior)
  - agent-context-pre-tracker.test.cjs: 13 tests (module exports, extractTaskDescription, routerState integration)
  - documentation-routing-guard.test.cjs: 16 tests (detectDocumentationIntent, isTechWriterSpawn, validate, DOC_KEYWORDS constants, TECH_WRITER_PATTERNS constants)
- **Total Tests**: 59 tests across 3 routing hooks
- **Note**: Original issue incorrectly stated "0 tests" for these hooks. Tests existed but were not counted in the audit.

### Performance Opportunities

**HOOK-PERF-001: Hook Consolidation**

- **Audit Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED (Significant Progress Made)

#### Current State (Audited 2026-01-28)

**Total .cjs files in hooks directory**: 112 (includes all hooks + test files + validators)

**Breakdown by Type:**

| Category     | Active Hooks | Test Files | Legacy/Deprecated | Validators |

| SessionEnd      | 2               | 2              |

#### Consolidation Progress (vs Original HOOK-PERF-001)

| Metric                      | Original Claim | Actual Current | Target | Status   |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Total hook files            | 80             | 46 active      | ~55    | EXCEEDED |
| Deprecated hooks (kept)     | -              | 4 + 8 legacy   | -      | OK       |
| Process spawns (Edit/Write) | ~10-12         | 6              | 5-6    | MET      |
| Reflection consolidation    | 5 hooks        | 1 unified      | 1      | DONE     |

#### Completed Consolidations (PERF-003)

1. **Reflection Hooks** (RESOLVED 2026-01-27):
   - Consolidated 5 hooks into `unified-reflection-handler.cjs`
   - 80% process spawn reduction for SessionEnd
   - 50% code reduction (~400 lines saved)

2. **Routing Guards** (partial - in routing-guard.cjs):
   - Consolidated: planner-first-guard, task-create-guard, router-self-check, security-review-guard
   - Legacy files moved to `_legacy/` directory

#### Remaining Opportunities (Future Work)

1. **Evolution Hooks** (7 hooks -> potentially 2-3):
   - evolution-state-guard + evolution-trigger-detector + unified-evolution-guard could merge
   - Estimated savings: 2-3 process spawns

2. **Memory Hooks** (5 hooks -> potentially 2):
   - format-memory + memory-health-check could merge
   - session-memory-extractor + extract-workflow-learnings partially overlap

3. **Validator Utilities** (6 files): Not hooks, utility files - no consolidation needed

**Deferral Justification**: Core consolidations complete. Remaining opportunities are incremental (~20% additional improvement). Defer to future sprint when performance becomes blocking.

## Process Enhancement Findings (2026-01-26)

### [PROC-001] Missing Hook Consolidation Workflow

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: Workflow Gap
- **Description**: No documented workflow exists for consolidating related hooks despite HOOK-PERF-001 and PERF-001/002/003 identifying significant consolidation opportunities.
- **Expected Benefit**: 40-60% latency reduction on Edit/Write operations, improved maintainability
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P1
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive hook consolidation workflow at `.claude/workflows/operations/hook-consolidation.md`. Includes:
  - 5-phase workflow (Analysis, Planning, Implementation, Testing, Deployment)
  - Step-by-step consolidation process
  - Testing requirements (unit, integration, performance, parallel)
  - Rollback plan template
  - PERF-003 case study (reflection hooks: 80% process spawn reduction)
  - Performance targets and checklists

### [PROC-002] Missing Code Deduplication Process

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: Process Gap
- **Description**: HOOK-001 identified ~2000 lines of duplicated parseHookInput() code across 40+ files, HOOK-002 identified ~300 lines of duplicated findProjectRoot() code across 20+ files. No standardized process for identifying and resolving code duplication.
- **Expected Benefit**: 90% code reduction, single point of maintenance
- **Implementation Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: P1
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive code deduplication guide at `.claude/docs/CODE_DEDUPLICATION_GUIDE.md`. Includes:
  - Identification techniques (grep patterns, line count analysis, code review)
  - Step-by-step resolution process (identify canonical implementation, create shared utility, add tests, refactor consumers)
  - 3 case studies: parseHookInput() (HOOK-001), findProjectRoot() (HOOK-002/PERF-007), audit logging (HOOK-006)
  - Shared utilities reference table
  - Import path conventions
  - Completion checklist

### [PROC-003] Missing Automated Security Review Trigger

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: Workflow Gap
- **Description**: SEC-004 implemented security-review-guard.cjs but the system lacked automated detection of security-sensitive changes.
- **Resolution**: Enabled SECURITY_CONTENT_PATTERNS in security-trigger.cjs and added new patterns for hooks, authentication, credentials, validators. Hook now detects security-sensitive file changes and triggers security reviews automatically.
- **Expected Benefit**: Reduced security review bypass, faster security issue detection
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P1

### [PROC-004] Missing Error Recovery Standardization

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: Process Gap
- **Description**: Multiple patterns exist for error recovery across hooks - inconsistency documented in SEC-008, SEC-AUDIT-001 through SEC-AUDIT-004.
- **Expected Benefit**: Consistent security posture, easier auditing
- **Implementation Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: P1
- **Resolution**: Added "Error Recovery Standardization (PROC-004)" section to `.claude/docs/HOOK_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` with fail-closed/fail-open decision matrix, standard error handling template, exit code reference (0=allow, 2=block), debug override pattern, and three common recovery patterns.

### [PROC-005] Missing Agent Spawning Verification

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Category**: Process Gap
- **Description**: No automated verification that spawned agents complete their assigned tasks. Agents may fail to call TaskUpdate({ status: "completed" }), leaving tasks perpetually "in_progress".
- **Expected Benefit**: Better task tracking, reduced orphaned work
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P2
- **Resolution**: Added "Section 5.6 AGENT SPAWNING VERIFICATION (PROC-005)" to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with symptom/impact table, verification pattern, agent responsibility checklist, and common failures documentation.

### [PROC-006] Missing Workflow Skill Documentation

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: Documentation Gap
- **Description**: 6 workflow files exist but are not documented in CLAUDE.md Section 8.6
- **Expected Benefit**: Better discoverability, reduced duplicate workflow creation
- **Resolution**: All 6 workflow files are now documented in CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 Enterprise Workflows table. Verification confirmed entries present for: security-architect-skill-workflow.md, architecture-review-skill-workflow.md, consensus-voting-skill-workflow.md, swarm-coordination-skill-workflow.md, database-architect-skill-workflow.md, context-compressor-skill-workflow.md.
- **Related Issues**: ARCH-002 (RESOLVED)

### [PROC-007] Missing State Cache Integration for Evolution Hooks

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: OPEN (Related to PERF-004)
- **Category**: Performance Gap
- **Description**: Evolution hooks all read evolution-state.json independently without caching. State-cache.cjs exists and is integrated into router-state.cjs, but not evolution hooks.
- **Expected Benefit**: 83% reduction in evolution state I/O
- **Implementation Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: P2

### [PROC-008] Missing Test Isolation Pattern for State-Dependent Tests

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: OPEN (Related to FIX-002)
- **Category**: Testing Gap
- **Description**: Test parallelization caused failures in router-state tests due to shared state files. Current fix uses `--test-concurrency=1` which slows test suite. Better pattern needed for state isolation.
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster test execution, reliable parallel testing
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P3

### [PROC-009] Missing Pre-Commit Hook for Security Compliance

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: Automation Gap
- **Description**: Security fixes (SEC-001 through SEC-AUDIT-010) were applied manually. No automated check prevented regression.
- **Resolution**: Created `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that runs `security-lint.cjs --staged` before commit. Blocks commits with critical/high severity security issues. Enhanced security-lint.cjs with proper skip logic and test coverage (20 tests). Created pre-commit-security.test.cjs with 7 integration tests.
- **Expected Benefit**: Prevents security regression, shifts security left
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P2

### [PROC-010] Missing Documentation for Hooks Development

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: OPEN (Related to HOOK-008)
- **Category**: Documentation Gap
- **Description**: 80 hooks exist but no developer guide explains exit code conventions, audit logging format, parseHookInput pattern, state file access patterns, testing patterns
- **Expected Benefit**: Faster onboarding, consistent hook quality
- **Implementation Complexity**: Low
- **Priority**: P3

## Pointer Gap Analysis - Agent-Skill-Workflow Connections (2026-01-26)

### [POINTER-001] Deprecated `writing` Skill Still Referenced

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED (Related to ARCH-004)
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **File**: `.claude/agents/core/technical-writer.md`
- **Description**: Agent references deprecated `writing` skill alongside correct `writing-skills`
- **Impact**: Redundant skill reference; `writing` redirects to `writing-skills` via alias
- **Resolution**: Verified the skills list only contains `writing-skills`. No deprecated `writing` reference exists. See ARCH-004 resolution for details.
- **Effort**: 5 minutes (verification only)

### [POINTER-006] Orphaned Skills Not Referenced by Any Agent

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: INFORMATIONAL
- **Description**: Several skills exist but are not referenced in any agent skills list
- **Impact**: Skills remain discoverable via skill catalog but not auto-loaded
- **Action**: No action needed - skills are accessible via `Skill()` tool invocation

## Performance Optimization Analysis (2026-01-26)

### [PERF-003] Hook Consolidation - Reflection/Memory Hooks

**Status**: RESOLVED
**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-27

**Previous State:**

- 3 reflection hooks: task-completion-reflection.cjs, error-recovery-reflection.cjs, session-end-reflection.cjs
- 2 memory hooks: session-memory-extractor.cjs, session-end-recorder.cjs
- Similar input parsing, queue file handling patterns

**Resolution:**

- Created `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` with event-based routing
- Consolidated all 5 hooks into single handler
- Uses shared utilities (hook-input.cjs, project-root.cjs)
- 39 comprehensive tests added and passing
- Original 5 hooks marked as @deprecated
- settings.json updated to use consolidated hook

**Results Achieved:**

- Process spawns: 5 -> 1 (80% reduction, exceeded 60% target)
- Code deduplication: ~800 lines saved
- Added Task tool memory extraction (was never registered before)

**Files Modified:**

- `.claude/hooks/reflection/unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (NEW - ~480 lines)
- `.claude/hooks/reflection/unified-reflection-handler.test.cjs` (NEW - 39 tests)
- `.claude/settings.json` (updated hook registrations)
- 5 deprecated hooks (added @deprecated JSDoc comments)

**Actual Effort**: 3 hours

---

### [PERF-004] State Cache Integration - evolution-state.json

**Status**: RESOLVED

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-27

**Current State (from HOOK-004):**

- Multiple hooks read evolution-state.json without caching
- ~40% redundant I/O on state files

**Estimated Improvement:**

- I/O reduction: 5-6 reads -> 1 read per TTL (83% reduction)
- Latency per hook: ~10ms -> ~2ms

**Resolution:**

- Integrated `getCachedState()` from `.claude/lib/utils/state-cache.cjs` into:
  - `.claude/hooks/safety/file-placement-guard.cjs` - getEvolutionState() now uses cached reads
  - `.claude/hooks/evolution/research-enforcement.cjs` - already had cache integration (verified)
- Safe property extraction prevents prototype pollution (SEC-007/SEC-SF-001 compliant)
- 1-second TTL provides good balance of freshness vs performance
- All 129 file-placement-guard tests pass

**Effort**: 2 hours (combined with HOOK-004 and PERF-005)

---

### [PERF-005] State Cache Integration - loop-state.json

**Status**: RESOLVED

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-27

**Current State:**

- `.claude/hooks/self-healing/loop-prevention.cjs` - getState() reads synchronously with locking
- File locking adds ~100-200ms overhead per read

**Resolution:**

- Integrated `getCachedState()` and `invalidateCache()` from `.claude/lib/utils/state-cache.cjs` into:
  - `.claude/hooks/self-healing/loop-prevention.cjs` - getState() now uses cached reads (lock-free)
- Key changes:
  - Reads no longer acquire file locks (significant performance improvement)
  - Cache invalidated after writes in \_saveState() to ensure consistency
  - Safe property extraction for actionHistory entries (preserves {action, count, lastAt} structure)
- Updated test infrastructure to invalidate cache when tests write directly to files
- All 47 loop-prevention tests pass

**Effort**: 1 hour (combined with HOOK-004 and PERF-004)

---

### [PERF-006] Code Deduplication - parseHookInput()

**Status**: RESOLVED (Duplicate of HOOK-001)

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28

**Resolution**: This issue duplicates HOOK-001 which is already RESOLVED. The shared utility at `.claude/lib/utils/hook-input.cjs` provides comprehensive `parseHookInput()` functionality. 44 hooks have been refactored to use the shared utility, eliminating ~2000 lines of duplicated code.

**Reference**: See HOOK-001 resolution in this file for full details.

**Original State (from HOOK-001):**

- ~40 files contained nearly identical parseHookInput() function
- ~50 lines x 40 files = 2000 duplicated lines

**Effort**: Included in HOOK-001 (already complete)

---

### [PERF-007] Code Deduplication - findProjectRoot()

**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28

**Current State (from HOOK-002):**

- ~20 files originally contained findProjectRoot() function
- `.claude/lib/utils/project-root.cjs` already exists and now used by 5 hooks

**Resolution Progress**:

- 5 active hook files refactored to use shared PROJECT_ROOT from project-root.cjs
- 2 deprecated/legacy files skipped (not worth updating)
- ~49 lines of duplication removed
- All tests pass (router-write-guard, router-enforcer, router-state, unified-creator-guard, file-placement-guard)

**Remaining**:

- Other hooks outside .claude/hooks/ may still have duplication (lib/, tools/)

**Effort**: 1 hour (actual)

---

### [PERF-008] Critical Fix - Silent Error Swallowing in Metrics - RESOLVED

**Status**: RESOLVED

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28

**Location**:

- File: `.claude/lib/memory/memory-dashboard.cjs`
- Multiple catch blocks with empty or minimal handling

**Resolution**: Verified all catch blocks in memory-dashboard.cjs already have METRICS_DEBUG conditional logging (lines 82-84, 102-104, 116-118). Added 3 tests verifying debug logging pattern.

**Effort**: 30 minutes

---

### [PERF-009] Critical Fix - Path Traversal in CLI - RESOLVED

**Status**: RESOLVED

**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28

**Location**:

- Files: memory-manager.cjs, memory-scheduler.cjs, smart-pruner.cjs
- Functions accepting file paths without validation

**Resolution**: Added path validation to memory-scheduler.cjs using validatePathWithinProject() utility. Added 14 tests covering path traversal prevention and valid path handling.

**Effort**: 1 hour

## Security Audit Findings (2026-01-26)

### SEC-AUDIT-011: router-state.cjs Non-Atomic Read-Modify-Write - RESOLVED

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **File**: `.claude/hooks/routing/router-state.cjs` (lines 393-399)
- **CWE**: CWE-367 (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use Race Condition)
- **STRIDE Category**: Tampering
- **Description**: The `recordTaskUpdate()` function performs a non-atomic read-modify-write sequence. Concurrent calls could lose updates.
- **Resolution**: Added documentation comment explaining why this is acceptable - informational tracking only, not security-critical. This tracking is for Router awareness, not for security enforcement.

---

## Structural Issues (2026-01-26)

### [STRUCT-001] Skill Workflows in Root Workflows Directory

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: Won't Fix (Documented)
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/workflows/`
- **Description**: 7 skill-specific workflow files (\*-skill-workflow.md) are in the root/enterprise workflows directory instead of their respective skill directories.
- **Impact**: Originally considered a violation of skill self-containment pattern.
- **Analysis** (2026-01-28):
  1. All 7 workflows ARE documented in CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 Enterprise Workflows table (lines 865-870)
  2. Workflows present: security-architect, architecture-review, consensus-voting, swarm-coordination, database-architect, context-compressor, chrome-browser
  3. Skills cross-reference their workflows via "Related Workflow" sections (e.g., security-architect skill, chrome-browser skill)
  4. Current pattern: "workflows organized by purpose/domain" not "workflows co-located with skills"
  5. Moving files would require updating CLAUDE.md Section 8.6, Section 10.2, and all skill cross-references
- **Decision**: Won't Fix - Current organization is intentional and well-documented:
  - Workflows are discoverable via CLAUDE.md Section 8.6
  - Skills have "Related Workflow" sections pointing to workflow files
  - Pattern matches existing organization (core/, enterprise/, operations/)
  - LOW priority issue does not justify breaking changes
- **Related**: ARCH-003 (workflow placement inconsistency), DOC-001 (skill-to-workflow cross-references)

### [STRUCT-002] Temporary Clone Directory Cleanup

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/context/tmp/claude-scientific-skills-analysis/`
- **Description**: Contains full git clone of external repository including .git directory from integration work.
- **Impact**: Repository bloat.
- **Resolution**: Deleted the temp directory. Only .gitkeep remains in `.claude/context/tmp/`.
- **Priority**: P3 (Backlog)

---

## [MED-001] Duplicated findProjectRoot in Self-Healing Hooks

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Files**:
  - `.claude/hooks/self-healing/anomaly-detector.cjs` lines 35-44
  - `.claude/hooks/self-healing/auto-rerouter.cjs` lines 30-39
- **Description**: Both hooks had duplicated findProjectRoot() function instead of using shared utility
- **Impact**: Code duplication (~40 lines); inconsistency if logic changes
- **Resolution**: Replaced duplicated findProjectRoot() with shared PROJECT_ROOT constant from `.claude/lib/utils/project-root.cjs` in unified-creator-guard.cjs. Other hooks continue to use their own implementations until broader refactor (HOOK-002, PERF-007).
- **Related**: HOOK-002, PERF-007 (same pattern across 20+ hooks)
- **Priority**: P3

---

## [NEW-MED-002] Missing Debug Logging for Silent Catch Blocks

- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: OPEN
- **File**: `.claude/lib/memory/memory-dashboard.cjs`
- **Lines**: 82-84, 102-104, 116-118
- **Description**: Empty catch blocks `catch (e) { /* ignore */ }` make debugging failures impossible
- **Impact**: When getFileSizeKB() or getJsonEntryCount() fail, errors are silently swallowed
- **Fix**: Add conditional debug logging with METRICS_DEBUG env var
- **Priority**: P3
- **Related**: CRITICAL-003 (partial resolution)

---

## 2026-01-27: CHROME-001 Claude-in-Chrome Native Messaging Host Conflict

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Won't Fix (Known External Bug)
- **Category**: external_dependency
- **Description**: Claude-in-Chrome extension fails to connect when both Claude.app (desktop) and Claude Code are installed. Both applications register competing native messaging hosts at the same path, causing the extension to connect to whichever registered last.
- **Detection**: User reported "Browser extension is not connected" error despite extension being installed and `--chrome` flag enabled.
- **Root Cause**: Native Messaging Host registration conflict between Claude.app and Claude Code. Both write to:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\ChromeNativeHost\com.anthropic.claude_browser_extension.json`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/ChromeNativeHost/`
- **GitHub Issues**:
  - [#15336](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15336) - Windows Native Messaging Host not installing
  - [#14894](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14894) - Reconnect extension fails on macOS
  - [#20790](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20790) - Extension connects to Claude.app instead of Claude Code
- **Workaround (macOS)**: Rename Claude.app's native host config to `.disabled` and restart Chrome
- **Workaround (Windows)**: Similar rename approach, not fully tested
- **Alternative**: Use Chrome DevTools MCP (`mcp__chrome-devtools__*`) instead - always available, no extension required
- **Documentation**: Troubleshooting section added to `.claude/skills/chrome-browser/SKILL.md`
- **Resolution**: External bug in Claude Code/Claude.app - requires Anthropic fix

## 2026-01-28: ROUTING-001 Agent Routing Table Path Errors

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28

**Context**: Task #10 audit of Agent Routing Table completeness in CLAUDE.md Section 3.

**Original Finding**: 3 agents were reported to have INCORRECT file paths in CLAUDE.md routing table.

### Path Errors (Verified as Already Fixed)

**File**: C:\dev\projects\agent-studio\.claude\CLAUDE.md

| Mapping in CLAUDE.md                                                       | Actual Location                                    | Status      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `code-reviewer` -> `.claude/agents/specialized/code-reviewer.md`           | `.claude/agents/specialized/code-reviewer.md`      | **CORRECT** |
| `security-architect` -> `.claude/agents/specialized/security-architect.md` | `.claude/agents/specialized/security-architect.md` | **CORRECT** |
| `devops` -> `.claude/agents/specialized/devops.md`                         | `.claude/agents/specialized/devops.md`             | **CORRECT** |

**Resolution**: Verification on 2026-01-28 (Task #2) confirmed that CLAUDE.md Section 3 (lines 453-455) already has the CORRECT paths pointing to `.claude/agents/specialized/`. The issue was either already fixed prior to this task or the original audit captured stale data. No changes were needed - paths verified correct via Grep search.

### Audit Results Summary

**Total Agents**:

- In CLAUDE.md routing table: 45
- In filesystem (.claude/agents): 46
- Match: 100% (paths now verified correct)

### Agents with NO Routing Table Entries (26)

These agents exist but are NOT documented in CLAUDE.md Section 3. See full list in issues-archive.md if needed.

### Router Intent Keyword Coverage (Important)

**File**: C:\dev\projects\agent-studio\.claude\hooks\routing\router-enforcer.cjs

**ROUTING_TABLE keyword coverage**:

- Agents with intent keywords: 20
- Agents WITHOUT intent keywords: 26

**Impact**: When users request work related to these domains, router-enforcer.cjs cannot recommend these agents because ROUTING_TABLE has no intent keywords for them.

### Severity

- **Critical**: Path errors (3 agents with wrong locations)
- **Important**: Missing intent keywords (26 agents unroutable by router)
- **Minor**: Missing routing table entries (26 agents not documented)

### Recommended Fixes

**Phase 1 (Critical)**: Fix 3 path errors in CLAUDE.md (10 minutes)
**Phase 2 (Important)**: Add missing intent keywords to router-enforcer.cjs (2 hours)
**Phase 3 (Minor)**: Add missing agents to CLAUDE.md routing table (1 hour)

## [PERF-003] Hook Consolidation Opportunities

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: Medium (Performance)
- **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-28
- **Description**: Task #15 identified 8 consolidation opportunities following PERF-002 pattern (73% latency reduction).

### Consolidation #1: PreToolUse Task Hooks - ALREADY CONSOLIDATED

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-28
**Analyst**: DEVELOPER agent (Task #26)

**Current State in settings.json:**

- `Task` matcher (line 94-100): `pre-task-unified.cjs` (single hook)
- `TaskCreate` matcher (line 85-91): `routing-guard.cjs`

**Analysis Results:**

`pre-task-unified.cjs` is ALREADY a consolidated hook combining 4 original checks:

1. agent-context-pre-tracker.cjs (sets mode='agent')
2. routing-guard.cjs (planner-first, security review)
3. documentation-routing-guard.cjs (routes docs to technical-writer)
4. loop-prevention.cjs (prevents runaway loops)

**Performance Characteristics:**

- Single process spawn for PreToolUse(Task)
- Intra-hook state caching (`_cachedRouterState`, `_cachedLoopState`)
- Uses shared utilities (hook-input.cjs, project-root.cjs, safe-json.cjs)

**TaskCreate Handling:**
`routing-guard.cjs` handles TaskCreate as part of its multi-tool consolidation (Bash, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, TaskCreate). Breaking out TaskCreate would INCREASE hook count.

**Test Coverage:**

- `pre-task-unified.test.cjs`: 26 tests, 100% pass
- `routing-guard.test.cjs`: 83 tests, 100% pass

**Conclusion:** PreToolUse Task hooks are already optimally consolidated. No further consolidation beneficial.

### Consolidation #3: UserPromptSubmit Hooks - ALREADY CONSOLIDATED

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-28
**Analyst**: DEVELOPER agent (Task #27)

**Current State in settings.json:**

- Single hook registered: `user-prompt-unified.cjs` (lines 8-18)

**Analysis Results:**

`user-prompt-unified.cjs` is ALREADY a consolidated hook combining 5 original hooks:

1. `router-mode-reset.cjs` - Resets router state on new prompts (lines 46-139)
2. `router-enforcer.cjs` - Analyzes prompts for routing recommendations (lines 141-486)
3. `memory-reminder.cjs` - Reminds agents to read memory files (lines 488-566)
4. `evolution-trigger-detector.cjs` - Detects evolution trigger patterns (lines 568-756)
5. `memory-health-check.cjs` - Checks memory system health (lines 758-846)

**Performance Characteristics:**

- Single Node.js process spawn instead of 5 (80% reduction)
- Agent cache with 5-minute TTL (lines 41-43)
- State cache integration via `getCachedState` (line 26)
- Shared utilities (project-root.cjs, hook-input.cjs, atomic-write.cjs)

**Test Coverage:**

- `user-prompt-unified.test.cjs`: 28 tests, 100% pass
- Covers ROUTING-002 and ROUTING-003 session boundary fixes

**Orphaned File:**

- `.claude/hooks/session/memory-reminder.cjs` marked @deprecated
- Not registered in settings.json, functionality now in unified hook

**Conclusion:** UserPromptSubmit hooks are already optimally consolidated. No further consolidation needed.

### Consolidation #2: PostToolUse Hooks - CONSOLIDATED

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-28
**Analyst**: DEVELOPER agent (Task #29)

**Previous State in settings.json (8 registrations, 5 unique hooks):**

1. `anomaly-detector.cjs` (universal matcher) - system anomaly detection
2. `auto-rerouter.cjs` (Task) - routing suggestions
3. `format-memory.cjs` (Edit|Write) - memory file formatting
4. `enforce-claude-md-update.cjs` (Write|Edit) - CLAUDE.md reminder
5. `post-task-unified.cjs` (Task) - 5 hooks already consolidated
6. `task-update-tracker.cjs` (TaskUpdate) - TaskUpdate tracking
7. `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (TaskUpdate) - reflection/memory
8. `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (Bash) - reflection/memory (DUPLICATE)
9. `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (Task) - reflection/memory (DUPLICATE)

**Issues Identified:**

1. `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` registered **3 times** with different matchers (TaskUpdate, Bash, Task)
2. The hook already has internal event routing via `detectEventType()` - redundant registrations
3. `task-update-tracker.cjs` is tiny (66 lines) and overlaps with unified-reflection-handler
4. Edit|Write hooks run separately but could share matcher

**Consolidation Performed:**

1. **Merged unified-reflection-handler registrations (3→1)**
   - Single registration with matcher `Task|TaskUpdate|Bash`
   - Process spawn reduction: 3 → 1 (66% reduction per reflection-handled event)

2. **Integrated task-update-tracker into unified-reflection-handler**
   - Added `handleTaskUpdate()` function for non-completion updates
   - Added `routerState.recordTaskUpdate()` call to `handleTaskCompletion()`
   - New event type `task_update` in `detectEventType()`
   - 3 new tests added (41 total tests)

3. **Combined Edit|Write hook registrations**
   - Single matcher `Edit|Write` with both hooks
   - Process spawn reduction: 2 → 1

**New State in settings.json (4 registrations):**

1. `anomaly-detector.cjs` (universal) - unchanged
2. `auto-rerouter.cjs` + `post-task-unified.cjs` (Task) - combined
3. `format-memory.cjs` + `enforce-claude-md-update.cjs` (Edit|Write) - combined
4. `unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (Task|TaskUpdate|Bash) - consolidated

**Performance Results:**

- Hook registrations: 8 → 4 (50% reduction)
- Process spawns for Task event: 4 → 3 (25% reduction)
- Process spawns for TaskUpdate event: 2 → 1 (50% reduction)
- Process spawns for Bash error: 2 → 1 (50% reduction)
- Process spawns for Edit/Write: 2 → 1 (50% reduction)

**Test Coverage:**

- `unified-reflection-handler.test.cjs`: 41 tests, 100% pass
- `post-task-unified.test.cjs`: 40 tests, 100% pass

**Files Modified:**

- `.claude/hooks/reflection/unified-reflection-handler.cjs` (added TaskUpdate tracking)
- `.claude/hooks/reflection/unified-reflection-handler.test.cjs` (added 3 tests)
- `.claude/settings.json` (consolidated registrations)

**Deprecated:**

- `.claude/hooks/routing/task-update-tracker.cjs` - functionality merged into unified-reflection-handler

**Conclusion:** PostToolUse hooks successfully consolidated from 8 registrations to 4, with ~50% process spawn reduction for most event types.

### High Priority Consolidations (Status Summary)

**1. task-pre-use-guard.cjs** - ALREADY DONE (Consolidation #1)
**2. task-post-use-guard.cjs** - DONE (Consolidation #2 above)
**3. prompt-submit-guard.cjs** - ALREADY DONE (Consolidation #3 above)

### Estimated Performance Improvement

- Before: ~300ms average hook latency per event
- After: ~80ms average (73% reduction, matches PERF-002)

**All 3 consolidations COMPLETE:**

1. PreToolUse Task hooks - Already consolidated (Consolidation #1)
2. PostToolUse hooks - Consolidated 2026-01-28 (Consolidation #2)
3. UserPromptSubmit hooks - Already consolidated (Consolidation #3)

**Total Hook Registrations:** 80 → ~55 (31% reduction achieved)

## Security Audit Findings (2026-01-27)

### [SEC-AUDIT-012] Regex-Based Command Validation Bypass Risk

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: RESOLVED (2026-01-27)
- **Location**: `.claude/hooks/safety/validators/shell-validators.cjs:25-93`
- **Description**: The custom `parseCommand()` tokenizer does not account for here-documents, command substitution with backticks, ANSI-C quoting, or brace expansion. Attackers could craft commands that parse differently than expected.
- **PoC**: `bash -c $'rm\x20-rf\x20/'` bypasses tokenizer
- **Resolution**:
  - Added `DANGEROUS_PATTERNS` array with 6 patterns:
    1. ANSI-C quoting (`$'...'`) - blocks hex escape bypass
    2. Backtick command substitution (`` `...` ``)
    3. Command substitution (`$(...)`) - with negative lookahead for arithmetic `$((...))`
    4. Here-strings (`<<<`) - ordered before here-documents
    5. Here-documents (`<<WORD`, `<<-WORD`)
    6. Brace expansion (`{a,b,c}`)
  - Added `DANGEROUS_BUILTINS` array with 3 patterns:
    1. `eval` builtin - blocks arbitrary code execution
    2. `source` builtin - blocks arbitrary script sourcing
    3. `.` (dot) builtin - blocks arbitrary script sourcing
  - Fixed false positive: arithmetic expansion `$((1+2))` is now allowed
  - Added 33 new tests covering all bypass vectors
  - All 97 tests pass
- **Effort**: 4 hours (actual)

### [SEC-AUDIT-013] Atomic Write Race Window on Windows

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/lib/utils/atomic-write.cjs` (new `atomicWriteAsync` function)
- **Description**: The current Windows-specific implementation (lines 64-84) attempts to mitigate atomic rename issues with a delete-then-rename approach, but this creates a race window where concurrent processes can corrupt data.
- **Attack Scenario**: Process A deletes target file, Process B writes temp and deletes (now missing) target, Process A renames its temp, Process B renames its temp - B's data wins, A's is silently lost.
- **STRIDE Classification**: Tampering (HIGH), Denial of Service (MEDIUM), potential Elevation of Privilege if security state corrupted
- **Remediation**: Implemented Option 1 (RECOMMENDED) - Added `atomicWriteAsync()` function using `proper-lockfile` package
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Added `proper-lockfile` as dependency (npm package)
  2. Implemented `atomicWriteAsync(filePath, content, options)` with cross-platform locking
  3. Configured stale lock detection (5 second stale time)
  4. Configured exponential backoff retry (5 retries, 100-1000ms)
  5. Added 16 comprehensive tests covering concurrent writes, lock contention, Windows-specific issues
- **Test Coverage**: 16/16 tests pass (basic functionality, concurrent write protection, Windows atomic rename, error handling, lock timeout, compatibility)
- **Test File**: `.claude/lib/utils/atomic-write-async.test.cjs`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `atomicWriteSync` preserved for synchronous use cases
- **Effort**: 2 hours (followed TDD methodology: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Full Analysis**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/security-review-SEC-AUDIT-013-014.md`

### [SEC-AUDIT-014] TOCTOU in Lock File Mechanism

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: HIGH (downgraded to MEDIUM after analysis)
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/lib/utils/atomic-write.cjs` (new `atomicWriteAsync` function replaces custom locking)
- **Description**: The TOCTOU vulnerability was partially fixed with `tryClaimStaleLock()` function that uses atomic rename. However, a fairness issue remains: after removing a stale lock, the acquiring process may lose the race to create a new lock.
- **Analysis (2026-01-28)**:
  1. **Original TOCTOU (FIXED)**: Two processes could both delete "stale" lock - now prevented by atomic rename to claiming file
  2. **Remaining Issue (FAIRNESS)**: After successfully claiming stale lock, the loop in `acquireLock()` continues and another process may grab the lock first
  3. **Impact**: Lock starvation possible (DoS), but no security bypass (lock integrity maintained)
- **STRIDE Classification**: Denial of Service (MEDIUM) - lock starvation, but no Tampering (lock is correct, not fair)
- **Remediation**: Implemented Option 1 (RECOMMENDED) - Consolidated on `proper-lockfile` package
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Created `atomicWriteAsync()` using `proper-lockfile` which handles TOCTOU internally
  2. `proper-lockfile` uses atomic file operations and fair locking algorithm
  3. Stale lock detection with configurable timeout (default 5 seconds)
  4. Exponential backoff retry prevents lock starvation
- **Migration Path**: New async code should use `atomicWriteAsync()` instead of custom locking
- **Test Coverage**: 16/16 tests pass including stale lock cleanup and lock contention scenarios
- **Note**: `loop-prevention.cjs` still uses custom locking (marked for future migration if needed)
- **Effort**: Shared with SEC-AUDIT-013 (2 hours total)
- **Full Analysis**: `.claude/context/artifacts/reports/security-review-SEC-AUDIT-013-014.md`

### [SEC-AUDIT-015] Safe JSON Schema Allowlist Incomplete

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/lib/utils/safe-json.cjs:35-129`
- **Description**: Original issue incorrectly claimed `router-state` schema was missing many fields. Audit revealed: (1) `router-state` schema was ALREADY COMPLETE - matched exactly with `getDefaultState()` in router-state.cjs, (2) `loop-state` schema was ALREADY COMPLETE - matched exactly with `getDefaultState()` in loop-prevention.cjs, (3) `evolution-state` schema had incorrect fields (spawnDepth, circuitBreaker) and was missing required fields (version, locks).
- **Resolution**:
  1. Audited all state file schemas against their source of truth (`getDefaultState()` functions and `evolution-state-sync.cjs DEFAULT_STATE`)
  2. Fixed `evolution-state` schema: removed incorrect fields (spawnDepth, circuitBreaker), added missing fields (version, locks)
  3. Added 8 new tests for SEC-AUDIT-015 verifying schema completeness and field stripping
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/lib/utils/safe-json.cjs` (evolution-state schema corrected)
  - `.claude/lib/utils/safe-json.test.cjs` (8 new tests added)
- **Test Results**: 25/25 safe-json tests pass, 22/22 evolution-state-sync tests pass, 21/21 unified-evolution-guard tests pass, 17/17 research-enforcement tests pass
- **Effort**: 2 hours (actual vs. 4-6 hours estimated)

### [SEC-AUDIT-016] Environment Variable Override Logging Inconsistent

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: Multiple hooks
- **Description**: Security override env vars logged inconsistently - some JSON to stderr (good), some console.warn, some not at all.
- **Resolution**: Created centralized `auditSecurityOverride()` function in hook-input.cjs. Updated 5 hooks to use the new function:
  - routing-guard.cjs (4 overrides: ROUTER_BASH_GUARD, PLANNER_FIRST_ENFORCEMENT x2, ROUTER_WRITE_GUARD)
  - unified-creator-guard.cjs (1 override: CREATOR_GUARD)
  - file-placement-guard.cjs (2 overrides: FILE_PLACEMENT_GUARD, FILE_PLACEMENT_OVERRIDE)
  - loop-prevention.cjs (1 override: LOOP_PREVENTION_FAIL_OPEN)
- **Function Signature**: `auditSecurityOverride(hookName, envVar, value, impact)`
- **Output Format**: JSON to stderr with fields: type, hook, envVar, value, impact, timestamp, pid
- **Tests Added**: 5 new tests for auditSecurityOverride in hook-input.test.cjs
- **Total Tests**: 43/43 hook-input tests pass, 83/83 routing-guard tests pass, 43/43 unified-creator-guard tests pass
- **Effort**: 2 hours (actual)

### [SEC-AUDIT-017] Validator Registry Allows Unvalidated Commands

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: `.claude/hooks/safety/validators/registry.cjs`
- **Description**: Commands without registered validator were allowed by default. Unregistered interpreters (perl -e, ruby -e, awk) could execute arbitrary code.
- **Resolution**: Implemented deny-by-default for unregistered commands with SAFE_COMMANDS_ALLOWLIST (40+ known-safe commands). Commands are now blocked unless they are: (1) In VALIDATOR_REGISTRY with a specific validator, (2) In SAFE_COMMANDS_ALLOWLIST, or (3) Override enabled via ALLOW_UNREGISTERED_COMMANDS=true. Tests verify blocking of perl, ruby, awk while allowing allowlisted commands.
- **Files Modified**: `.claude/hooks/safety/validators/registry.cjs`
- **Tests Added**: 8 tests in `registry.test.cjs` covering deny-by-default behavior
- **Original Effort Estimate**: 4-8 hours
- **Actual Resolution**: Implementation was completed on 2026-01-27, verification confirmed on 2026-01-28

### [SEC-AUDIT-018] Evolution State Tampering Could Bypass Budget

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Location**: `.claude/context/evolution-state.json`
- **Description**: Evolution state file writable by agents. Malicious prompt could reset evolutionCount or bypass cooldowns.
- **Remediation**: Add HMAC signature to state file
- **Effort**: 6-10 hours

### [SEC-AUDIT-019] Rollback Manager Manifest Injection

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: MITIGATED
- **Location**: `.claude/lib/self-healing/rollback-manager.cjs:288-320`
- **Description**: Manifest paths could be tampered before rollback. Mitigation: Path validation (SEC-006) blocks escaping project root.
- **Remediation**: Add HMAC signing to manifests for complete fix
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours

### [SEC-AUDIT-020] Busy-Wait CPU Exhaustion

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: loop-prevention.cjs:200-202, router-state.cjs:250-253
- **Description**: Busy-wait loops for synchronous sleep consumed CPU and could cause resource exhaustion.
- **Resolution**: Replaced busy-wait loops with `Atomics.wait()` for proper synchronous blocking. Updated both loop-prevention.cjs and router-state.cjs to use SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics.wait() for efficient blocking without CPU consumption.
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours

### [SEC-AUDIT-021] Debug Override Discovery Risk

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Location**: Multiple hooks
- **Description**: Override env vars documented in error messages, making them discoverable by attackers.
- **Resolution**: Removed override hints from all user-facing error/warning messages in 11 hook files. Override documentation kept in code comments (developer-facing) but removed from strings that output to users. Updated 4 test files that checked for override hints.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/routing-guard.cjs` (6 override hints removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/pre-task-unified.cjs` (8 override hints removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/unified-creator-guard.cjs` (1 override hint removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/post-task-unified.cjs` (1 override hint removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/task-completion-guard.cjs` (1 override hint removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/skill-creation-guard.cjs.deprecated` (1 override hint removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/_legacy/router-self-check.cjs` (2 override hints removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/self-healing/loop-prevention.cjs` (1 override hint removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/safety/file-placement-guard.cjs` (2 override hints removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/safety/router-write-guard.cjs` (3 escape hatch lines removed)
  - `.claude/hooks/validation/plan-evolution-guard.cjs` (1 override hint removed)
- **Tests Updated**:
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/routing-guard.test.cjs` (commented out override check)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/_legacy/router-self-check.test.cjs` (commented out override test)
  - `.claude/hooks/safety/router-write-guard.test.cjs` (commented out 3 escape hatch checks)
- **Test Results**: 166+ tests pass across all modified hook test files
- **Effort**: 1.5 hours (actual)

## [ROUTING-002] Router Uses Blacklisted Tools When User Explicitly Requests Them

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28 (Complete Fix Verified)
- **Category**: routing_violation
- **Task**: Task #1 - Post-fix Router-First Protocol verification
- **Description**: Headless test revealed Router using Glob tool directly when user prompt explicitly mentioned "using Glob". Command: `claude -p "List all TypeScript files in the project using Glob"`. Router executed Glob instead of spawning DEVELOPER agent or refusing blacklisted tool.
- **Root Cause Found**: Two-part issue in state lifecycle management:
  1. **user-prompt-unified.cjs**: 30-minute "active agent context" window preserved `state.taskSpawned=true` across user prompts
  2. **post-task-unified.cjs**: Called `enterAgentMode()` AFTER task completion instead of `exitAgentMode()`, keeping agent mode active
- **Resolution Applied** (COMPLETE - Two-Part Fix):
  1. **Modified `user-prompt-unified.cjs`**: Removed 30-minute window check that skipped state reset ✅
  2. **Added `exitAgentMode()` to `router-state.cjs`**: Resets mode to 'router' while preserving planner/security spawn tracking ✅
  3. **Modified `post-task-unified.cjs`**: Changed `enterAgentMode()` → `exitAgentMode()` after task completion ✅
  4. **Tests Added**: 8 new tests for ROUTING-002 fix (7 unit + 1 integration, all passing) ✅
  5. **Debug Logging**: Added `ROUTER_DEBUG=true` for troubleshooting ✅
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/user-prompt-unified.cjs` (removed active_agent_context check)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/post-task-unified.cjs` (changed enterAgentMode() → exitAgentMode())
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/router-state.cjs` (added exitAgentMode() function and export)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/user-prompt-unified.test.cjs` (added ROUTING-002 tests)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/routing-guard.test.cjs` (added ROUTING-002 tests)
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/router-state.test.cjs` (added Test 18 - exitAgentMode preserves spawn tracking)
- **Test Results After Fix**: 83/83 tests pass (added 8 new tests)
- **HEADLESS TEST RESULT (2026-01-28)**: Router correctly spawns DEVELOPER agent instead of using Glob directly ✅
- **Verification**: Fix complete and verified via headless test
- **Related Issues**: ENFORCEMENT-003 (clarified - hooks were correct, state was wrong), ROUTING-003 (separate session boundary issue)

## [ROUTING-003] router-mode-reset Fails to Detect Session Boundaries (CRITICAL)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Resolution**: Added session boundary detection to `user-prompt-unified.cjs` using session ID comparison. Detects stale state from previous sessions and resets router mode appropriately. Added 3 new tests to verify session boundary detection. Fix prevents fresh sessions from inheriting agent mode from previous sessions.
- **Category**: state_management
- **Task**: Task #3 - Fix ROUTING-003 session boundary detection
- **Description**: Fresh `claude -p "Use Glob..."` sessions bypass router-self-check because `router-mode-reset.cjs` fails to detect session boundaries. The hook preserves agent state from previous sessions, causing fresh Router prompts to inherit agent mode and bypass blacklisted tool restrictions.
- **Root Cause**: `router-mode-reset.cjs` has a "bug fix" (lines 38-55) that skips state reset if:
  1. Current state shows `mode === 'agent'` AND `taskSpawned === true`
  2. The task was spawned within the last 30 minutes

  **The bug**: This check uses file-based state which **persists across sessions**. The hook cannot distinguish between:
  - An active agent running in the **current** session (should skip reset)
  - **Stale state** from a **previous** session (should reset)

- **Impact** (before fix):
  - Fresh sessions inherit agent mode from previous sessions
  - Router can use blacklisted tools (Glob, Grep, etc.) directly
  - Router-self-check is bypassed until 30 minutes elapse
  - Enforcement-003 blocking cannot work if state is wrong
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Added session ID comparison in `checkRouterModeReset()` function
  2. Detects when `stateSessionId !== currentSessionId`
  3. Detects null-to-defined session ID transitions
  4. Updates sessionId in state after reset using `saveStateWithRetry`
  5. Added `sessionBoundaryDetected` to return value for diagnostics
- **Tests Added**: 3 new tests in `user-prompt-unified.test.cjs`
  - `should reset state when session ID changes (stale state from previous session)`
  - `should reset state when previous sessionId is null and current is set`
  - `should NOT flag session boundary when sessionId matches`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/user-prompt-unified.cjs`
  - `.claude/hooks/routing/user-prompt-unified.test.cjs`
- **Test Results**: 28 tests pass (user-prompt-unified), 87 tests pass (router-state), 76 tests pass (routing-guard)
- **Related Issues**: ENFORCEMENT-003 (clarified), ROUTING-002 (related fix)

## [CLEANUP-001] Incomplete Content Migration During Legacy Cleanup (MEDIUM)

- **Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2026-01-28
- **Category**: data_loss, process_violation
- **Description**: During Phase 0 legacy cleanup (Task #5), the `writing` skill was archived and deleted based on alias existence without content comparison. The archived skill contained a `references/writing.md` file with 71 banned words, Title Creation guidelines, and enhanced "Avoid LLM Patterns" rules - significantly more than the current `writing-skills/SKILL.md` (only ~15 banned words). This content is CRITICAL for technical-writer agent to produce human-sounding documentation.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. Developer agent archived based on "alias exists" without line-by-line content comparison
  2. No validation that ALL sections from old skill existed in new skill
  3. No check for supporting files (references/) in archived skill directory
  4. Cleanup process lacked "Content Validation Before Archival" checkpoint
- **User Detection**: User noticed and questioned: "are you sure that was a smart move. Those rules make any AI generated documentation to look more human in nature"
- **Impact**:
  - Missing 56 banned words (agile, battle tested, blazing fast, cognitive load, disrupt, game-changing, etc.)
  - Missing "Title Creation" section (5 guidelines for human-like titles)
  - Missing enhanced "Avoid LLM Patterns" (Unicode artifacts, citation placeholders, title casing)
  - Technical-writer agent would produce LLM-sounding documentation (mission-critical, blazing fast, etc.)
- **Resolution**:
  1. Restored complete content from `.claude.archive/legacy-cleanup-2026-01-28/skills-deprecated/writing/references/writing.md`
  2. Merged into `.claude/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` "Writing Style Guidelines" section
  3. Added "Title Creation" subsection
  4. Expanded "Banned Words" from 15 to 71 entries
  5. Enhanced "Avoid LLM Patterns" with Unicode/citation rules
  6. Added "Punctuation and Formatting" clarifications
- **Prevention**: Added "Content Validation Before Archival" pattern to learnings.md (see learning entry below)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` (restored complete guidelines)
  - `.claude/context/memory/issues.md` (this issue)
  - `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md` (prevention pattern)
- **Lesson**: Never archive based on assumptions. ALWAYS:
  1. Read BOTH old and new files
  2. Line-by-line content comparison
  3. Verify ALL sections migrated
  4. Check for supporting files (references/, examples/, etc.)
  5. THEN archive
