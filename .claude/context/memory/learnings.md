**Key Implementation Details**:

1. **Phase 0: Research & Planning (MANDATORY)**:
   - Cannot be skipped - enforced by planner workflow
   - Minimum 3 Exa/WebSearch queries required
   - Minimum 3 external sources with citations
   - Research report saved to `.claude/context/artifacts/research-reports/`
   - ADRs created for major decisions

2. **Constitution Checkpoint (4 Blocking Gates)**:
   - **Gate 1: Research Completeness** - 3+ sources, all unknowns resolved, ADRs documented
   - **Gate 2: Technical Feasibility** - Approach validated, dependencies available, no blockers
   - **Gate 3: Security Review** - Implications assessed, threat model if needed, mitigations identified
   - **Gate 4: Specification Quality** - Criteria measurable, success criteria testable, edge cases considered
   - **BLOCKING**: If ANY gate fails, return to research phase

3. **Research-Synthesis Skill Integration**:
   - Phase 0 invokes `research-synthesis` skill for systematic research
   - Consistent with EVOLVE workflow pattern (minimum 3 queries, 3 sources)
   - Research output follows standard format for traceability

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added "Phase 0: Research & Planning" section to Workflow
   - Updated Plan Template Structure to show Phase 0 as first mandatory phase
   - Added "Phase 0: Research Integration (ADR-045)" section explaining rationale
   - Provided 2 examples: complete plan with Phase 0, constitution checkpoint failure scenario

5. **Why This Matters**:
   - **Prevents Premature Implementation**: Research validates approach before coding
   - **Documents Decision Rationale**: ADRs explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - **Identifies Security Early**: Security review before implementation, not after
   - **Validates Feasibility**: Technical unknowns resolved through research
   - **Industry Standard**: ADRs, RFCs, Google Design Docs all use research-first

**Integration Points**:

- Works with `research-synthesis` skill for conducting research
- Works with `security-architect` agent for Gate 3 (Security Review)
- Works with `plan-generator` skill for creating plans
- Works with `task-breakdown` skill for implementation tasks

**File Modified**: `.claude/agents/core/planner.md`

**ADR Reference**: ADR-045 (Research-Driven Planning)

**Impact**: All plans generated by planner agent will now include Phase 0 research as the mandatory first phase, with constitution checkpoint blocking implementation until all 4 gates pass.
