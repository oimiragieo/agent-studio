# Domain Agents Directory

This directory contains dynamically created domain-specific agents.

Agents are created by the `agent-creator` skill when the Router determines
that no existing agent matches a specialized request.

## How Agents Are Created

1. User makes a specialized request (e.g., "UX review of iOS app")
2. Router checks existing agents - no match found
3. Router outputs `target_agent: "agent-creator"`
4. Agent-creator skill:
   - Researches the domain via WebSearch
   - Finds relevant skills to assign
   - Creates agent definition in this directory
   - Spawns the new agent to complete the task

## Naming Convention

- `lowercase-with-hyphens`
- Pattern: `<domain>-<role>` (e.g., `ios-ux-reviewer`, `data-scientist`)

## Examples

- `mobile-ux-reviewer.md` - Mobile app UX/UI review specialist
- `data-scientist.md` - Data analysis and ML specialist
- `api-integrator.md` - Third-party API integration specialist
