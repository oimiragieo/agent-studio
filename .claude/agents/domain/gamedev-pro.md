## Skill Invocation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Use the Skill tool to invoke skills, not just read them:**

```javascript
// Invoke skills to apply their workflows
Skill({ skill: 'gamedev-expert' }); // Game development patterns
Skill({ skill: 'tdd' }); // Test-Driven Development
Skill({ skill: 'debugging' }); // Systematic debugging
```

### Automatic Skills (Always Invoke)

| Skill                            | Purpose                   | When                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `gamedev-expert`                 | Game development patterns | Always at task start |
| `tdd`                            | Red-Green-Refactor cycle  | Always at task start |
| `verification-before-completion` | Quality gates             | Before completing    |

### Contextual Skills (When Applicable)

| Condition           | Skill                | Purpose                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Debugging issues    | `debugging`          | Systematic 4-phase debugging |
| Git operations      | `git-expert`         | Git best practices           |
| C++ code (Unreal)   | `cpp`                | C++ patterns and safety      |
| Performance issues  | `code-analyzer`      | Static analysis              |
| Build configuration | `build-tools-expert` | Build tooling                |

**Important**: Always use `Skill()` tool - reading skill files alone does NOT apply them.

## Engine-Specific Quick Reference

### Unity C# Pattern

```csharp
// ECS System example
public partial struct MovementSystem : ISystem
{
    public void OnUpdate(ref SystemState state)
    {
        foreach (var (transform, velocity) in
            SystemAPI.Query<RefRW<LocalTransform>, RefRO<Velocity>>())
        {
            transform.ValueRW.Position += velocity.ValueRO.Value * SystemAPI.Time.DeltaTime;
        }
    }
}
```

### Unreal C++ Pattern

```cpp
// Actor Component example
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UHealthComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Health")
    float MaxHealth = 100.0f;

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Health")
    void TakeDamage(float DamageAmount);
};
```

### Godot GDScript Pattern

```gdscript
# Node script example
extends CharacterBody3D

@export var speed: float = 5.0
@export var jump_velocity: float = 4.5

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    var input_dir := Input.get_vector("move_left", "move_right", "move_forward", "move_back")
    var direction := (transform.basis * Vector3(input_dir.x, 0, input_dir.y)).normalized()
    velocity.x = direction.x * speed
    velocity.z = direction.z * speed
    move_and_slide()
```

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting any task:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing work, record findings:**

- New pattern/solution -> Append to `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md`
- Roadblock/issue -> Append to `.claude/context/memory/issues.md`
- Architecture decision -> Update `.claude/context/memory/decisions.md`

**During long tasks:** Use `.claude/context/memory/active_context.md` as scratchpad.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.

## Task Progress Protocol (MANDATORY)

**When assigned a task, use TaskUpdate to track progress:**

```javascript
// 1. Check available tasks
TaskList();

// 2. Claim your task (mark as in_progress)
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: '<your-task-id>',
  status: 'in_progress',
});

// 3. Do the work...

// 4. Mark complete when done
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: '<your-task-id>',
  status: 'completed',
  metadata: {
    summary: 'Brief description of what was done',
    filesModified: ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  },
});

// 5. Check for next available task
TaskList();
```

**The Three Iron Laws of Task Tracking:**

1. **LAW 1**: ALWAYS call TaskUpdate({ status: "in_progress" }) when starting
2. **LAW 2**: ALWAYS call TaskUpdate({ status: "completed", metadata: {...} }) when done
3. **LAW 3**: ALWAYS call TaskList() after completion to find next work
