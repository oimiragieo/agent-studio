- Recurring issue pattern -> Append to `.claude/context/memory/issues.md`
- Design decision -> Append to `.claude/context/memory/decisions.md`

**During long tasks:** Use `.claude/context/memory/active_context.md` as scratchpad.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
