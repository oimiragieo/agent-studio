# CUJ-035: Planner-First Workflow Validation

## User Goal
Validate the complete planner-first workflow process end-to-end, ensuring plans are created, artifacts flow correctly, and execution follows the plan.

## Trigger
- "Test planner-first workflow"
- "Validate plan execution"
- "Verify artifact flow"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner agent activated
- Analyzes user requirements comprehensively
- Coordinates with relevant specialists (Analyst, PM, Architect)
- Creates structured plan with steps, dependencies, risks
- Validates plan completeness and feasibility
- Generates plan artifacts:
  - `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md` - Plan markdown document
  - `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json` - Structured plan data


### Step 0.1: Plan Rating Gate
- Agent: orchestrator
- Type: validation
- Skill: response-rater
- Validates plan quality (minimum score: 7/10)
- Rubric: completeness, feasibility, risk mitigation, agent coverage, integration
- If score < 7: Return to Planner with feedback
- If score >= 7: Proceed to execution
- Records rating in `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/plans/<plan_id>-rating.json`

### Step 1: Plan Execution Tracking
- Orchestrator reads plan document
- Verifies plan structure and completeness
- Tracks plan execution progress
- Monitors artifact creation

### Step 2: Artifact Flow Validation
- Verifies artifacts are created as specified in plan
- Validates artifact dependencies are satisfied
- Checks artifact structure matches plan expectations
- Confirms artifacts are passed correctly between steps

### Step 3: Execution Validation
- Verifies each step executes according to plan
- Validates agent assignments match plan
- Confirms dependencies are respected
- Checks success criteria are met

### Step 4: Plan Update Validation
- Planner updates plan status based on execution
- Verifies plan reflects actual progress
- Confirms plan updates are accurate
- Validates stateless behavior (plan read from file, not chat history)

## Agents Used
- Planner (plan creation and tracking)
- Orchestrator (execution coordination)
- [Other agents as specified in plan]

## Skills Used
- `plan-generator` - Creates structured plans
- Plan tracking and validation
- `response-rater` - Plan quality validation

## Expected Outputs
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md` - Plan markdown document
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json` - Structured plan data
- Artifacts as specified in plan
- Plan execution tracking report
- Artifact flow validation report

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Plan created with all required sections
- [ ] Plan rating >= 7/10 (recorded in `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/plans/<plan_id>-rating.json`)
- [ ] Rating recorded in run state (validation: rating file exists)
- ✅ Plan structure is valid (JSON schema validation)
- ✅ Artifacts flow correctly between steps
- ✅ Execution follows plan steps
- ✅ Dependencies are respected
- ✅ Plan updates reflect actual progress
- ✅ Stateless behavior verified (plan read from file)
- ✅ All success criteria from plan are met

## Example Prompts
```
"Test the planner-first workflow with a simple feature"
"Validate that plan execution works correctly"
"Verify artifact flow in planner-first workflow"
```
