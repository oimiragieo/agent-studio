# CUJ-053: Publishing Metadata Persistence Test

## User Goal
Validate that publishing metadata persists correctly across workflow runs and system restarts.

## Trigger
- "Test publishing persistence"
- "Validate publishing metadata storage"
- "Check publishing status persistence"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates persistence test plan
- Identifies test scenarios for publishing metadata persistence
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`

### Step 1: Create and Publish Artifact
- Create test artifact with `publishable: true`
- Register artifact in registry using `run-manager.mjs`
- Publish artifact using `artifact-publisher` skill
- Verify publishing metadata in registry

### Step 2: Verify Persistence After Update
- Update artifact (modify content)
- Re-register artifact with new version
- Verify publishing metadata preserved from previous version
- Check `publish_attempts` history maintained

### Step 3: Test Registry Reload
- Save registry to disk
- Reload registry from disk
- Verify publishing metadata persisted correctly:
  - `published: true`
  - `published_at` timestamp
  - `publish_status: 'success'`
  - `publish_attempts` array
  - `publish_targets` array

### Step 4: Test Failed Publishing Persistence
- Create artifact that fails to publish
- Verify failure metadata persisted:
  - `publish_status: 'failed'`
  - `publish_error` message
  - Failed attempt in `publish_attempts` array
- Reload registry and verify failure metadata still present

### Step 5: Test Retry Persistence
- Retry publishing failed artifact
- Verify retry attempts added to `publish_attempts` array
- Check each attempt has timestamp, status, error
- Reload registry and verify all retry attempts persisted

### Step 6: Test Cross-Run Persistence
- Complete workflow run
- Start new workflow run
- Load previous run's registry
- Verify publishing metadata from previous run accessible

## Agents Used
- Planner (persistence test planning)
- QA (persistence validation)

## Skills Used
- `artifact-publisher` - Publishing artifacts with metadata tracking
- `plan-generator` - Creating persistence test plan

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Artifact registry: `run-manager.mjs` with `registerArtifact()` and `updateArtifactPublishingStatus()`
- Registry persistence: `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/artifact-registry.json`
- Publishing status tracking

## Expected Outputs
- Persistence test plan: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`
- Test artifacts with publishing metadata
- Registry files: `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/artifact-registry.json`
- Persistence validation report: `publishing-persistence-report.json`

## Success Criteria

Each criterion references verifiable artifacts for objective pass/fail validation:
- [ ] Publishing metadata persists after registry save/reload (artifact: `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/artifact-registry.json`, validated by schema)
- [ ] `published_at` timestamp preserved correctly (validated by ISO 8601 format check)
- [ ] `publish_attempts` array persists all attempts (validated by array length and content)
- [ ] Failed publishing metadata persists: `publish_status: 'failed'` and `publish_error` (validated by registry content)
- [ ] Retry attempts accumulate in `publish_attempts` array (validated by array growth)
- [ ] Cross-run persistence: previous run metadata accessible (validated by registry read from previous run_id)
- [ ] Metadata survives system restart (validated by registry reload after restart simulation)

## Example Prompts
```
"Test publishing metadata persistence"
"Validate publishing status storage"
"Check if publishing metadata survives restarts"
```
