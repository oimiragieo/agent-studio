# CUJ-044: Agent Fallback Chain

## User Goal
Test fallback agent routing when primary agents fail, ensuring fallback agents receive correct context, artifacts are preserved, and the system recovers gracefully.

## Trigger
- "Test agent fallback routing"
- "Validate fallback agent context"
- "Test fallback chain recovery"
- Primary agent fails with non-recoverable error
- Primary agent times out
- Primary agent produces invalid output after retries

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates plan with fallback scenarios
- Identifies primary and fallback agents
- Defines fallback routing logic
- Specifies context preservation requirements

### Step 1: Primary Agent Execution
- Primary agent (e.g., Architect) receives task
- Creates initial artifacts
- Attempts to complete task
- **Failure**: Agent fails with non-recoverable error

### Step 2: Failure Detection
- Orchestrator detects primary agent failure
- Categorizes failure type:
  - Non-recoverable error
  - Timeout
  - Invalid output after max retries (3)
- Checks agent definition for `fallback_agent` field
- If not specified, uses capability matrix

### Step 3: Fallback Agent Selection
- **Option A**: Use explicit `fallback_agent` from agent definition
- **Option B**: Use capability matrix:
  - Architect → Developer (for implementation)
  - PM → Analyst (for requirements analysis)
  - Analyst → PM (for product requirements)
- Select fallback agent based on failure type

### Step 4: Context Preservation
- **Preserve All Artifacts**: Pass all artifacts from previous steps
- **Include Error Details**: Pass error details from primary agent
- **Provide Task Requirements**: Pass original task requirements
- **Include Constraints**: Pass technical/business constraints
- **Document Fallback**: Log fallback reason in reasoning file

### Step 5: Fallback Agent Execution
- Fallback agent receives full context
- Verifies required artifacts exist
- Verifies fallback agent has required tools/context
- Executes task using fallback approach
- Creates output artifacts

### Step 6: Fallback Validation
- Verify fallback agent received correct context
- Verify all artifacts preserved
- Verify error details included
- Verify task requirements clear
- Verify output quality acceptable

### Step 7: Plan Update
- Update plan document with fallback agent assignment
- Document fallback reason
- Update task status
- Track fallback success/failure

## Agents Used
- Planner (planning with fallback scenarios)
- Primary Agent (e.g., Architect) - Fails
- Fallback Agent (e.g., Developer) - Recovers
- Orchestrator (fallback routing)

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Fallback agent routing (orchestrator capability)
- Context preservation (orchestrator capability)
- Error handling (orchestrator capability)
- Plan updating (planner capability)

## Expected Outputs
- Primary agent artifacts (partial)
- Error details from primary agent
- Fallback agent artifacts (complete)
- Fallback routing documentation
- Updated plan document

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Primary agent failure detected correctly (artifact: failure-detection.json)
- [ ] Fallback agent selected appropriately (artifact: fallback-routing.json)
- [ ] All artifacts preserved during fallback (artifact: registry-{id}.json)
- [ ] Error details passed to fallback agent (artifact: error-context.json)
- [ ] Fallback agent receives correct context (artifact: context-passing.json)
- [ ] Fallback agent has required tools/context (artifact: capability-verification.json)
- [ ] Task completed successfully by fallback agent (validated by gate file)
- [ ] Plan updated with fallback assignment (artifact: plan-{id}.json)
- [ ] Fallback reason documented (artifact: reasoning-{step}.json)

## Example Prompts
```
"Test agent fallback routing when Architect fails"
"Validate fallback agent context preservation"
"Test fallback chain recovery"
```

## Fallback Agent Selection Logic

### Explicit Fallback (Preferred)
- Check agent definition for `fallback_agent` field
- Use specified fallback if available
- Example: `fallback_agent: developer` in architect.md

### Capability Matrix (Fallback)
If no explicit fallback specified, use capability matrix:

| Primary Agent | Fallback Agent | Reason |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Architect | Developer | Implementation capability |
| PM | Analyst | Requirements analysis |
| Analyst | PM | Product requirements |
| Database Architect | Architect | Schema design |
| UX Expert | Developer | UI implementation |
| Technical Writer | Developer | Documentation |
| QA | Developer | Test implementation |
| Performance Engineer | Architect | Performance design |
| Security Architect | Architect | Security design |
| Mobile Developer | Developer | Mobile implementation |
| Incident Responder | DevOps | Incident resolution |

### Fallback Routing Decision Tree
```
Primary Agent Fails?
|- Yes -> Check agent definition for fallback_agent
|   |- Found -> Route to specified fallback
|   `- Not Found -> Use capability matrix
|       `- Route to fallback agent
`- No -> Continue with primary agent
```

## Context Preservation Requirements

### Artifacts
- **All Previous Artifacts**: Pass all artifacts from previous steps
- **Artifact Registry**: Include artifact registry state
- **Validation Status**: Include validation status for each artifact

### Error Details
- **Error Type**: Non-recoverable, timeout, invalid output
- **Error Message**: Specific error message from primary agent
- **Retry Attempts**: Number of retries attempted (max 3)
- **Failure Reason**: Detailed failure reason

### Task Context
- **Original Requirements**: Original task requirements
- **Constraints**: Technical/business constraints
- **Dependencies**: Task dependencies
- **Success Criteria**: Expected success criteria

### Agent Capabilities
- **Required Tools**: Tools needed for task
- **Required Context**: Context needed for task
- **Verify Fallback Agent**: Check fallback agent has required capabilities

## Fallback Validation Checklist

### Before Fallback Routing
- [ ] Primary agent failure confirmed (non-recoverable)
- [ ] Max retries exceeded (3 attempts)
- [ ] Fallback agent identified
- [ ] Fallback agent capabilities verified

### During Fallback Routing
- [ ] All artifacts preserved
- [ ] Error details included
- [ ] Task requirements clear
- [ ] Constraints passed
- [ ] Fallback reason logged

### After Fallback Execution
- [ ] Fallback agent received correct context
- [ ] Task completed successfully
- [ ] Output quality acceptable
- [ ] Plan updated with fallback assignment
- [ ] Fallback success tracked

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Explicit Fallback
- Architect fails with non-recoverable error
- Architect definition specifies `fallback_agent: developer`
- Route to Developer with full context
- Developer completes task successfully

### Scenario 2: Capability Matrix Fallback
- PM fails with timeout
- PM definition has no explicit fallback
- Use capability matrix: PM → Analyst
- Route to Analyst with full context
- Analyst completes task successfully

### Scenario 3: Context Preservation
- Architect fails mid-task
- Artifacts created: project-brief.json, prd.json
- Fallback to Developer
- Verify Developer receives both artifacts
- Verify Developer has architecture context
- Developer completes implementation

### Scenario 4: Fallback Chain
- Primary agent fails
- Fallback agent also fails
- Second fallback agent succeeds
- Verify context preserved through chain
- Verify final output acceptable

### Scenario 5: Invalid Output Fallback
- Primary agent produces invalid output
- After 3 retries, output still invalid
- Route to fallback agent
- Fallback agent produces valid output
- Verify output quality acceptable
