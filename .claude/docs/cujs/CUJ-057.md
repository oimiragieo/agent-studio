# CUJ-057: Plan Rating Validation

## User Goal
Validate that the response-rater skill correctly enforces the minimum 7/10 plan quality score.

## Trigger
- "Test plan rating"
- "Validate response-rater"
- "Check plan enforcement"
- "Test plan quality gates"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `workflow`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- **Agent**: Planner
- **Input**: Test plan validation requirements
- **Output**: Test execution plan (`plan-{id}.json`)

### Step 0.1: Plan Rating Gate
- **Agent**: Orchestrator
- **Type**: Validation
- **Skill**: response-rater
- **Minimum Score**: 7/10
- **Rubric**: completeness, feasibility, risk mitigation, agent coverage, integration
- **Action if < 7**: Return to Planner with feedback, request improvements
- **Action if >= 7**: Proceed to execution

### Step 1: Create Test Plan
- **Agent**: Developer
- **Actions**: Generate plan with known quality level
- **Output**: Test plan artifact with varying quality levels

### Step 2: Rate Plan
- **Agent**: Orchestrator
- **Skill**: response-rater
- **Input**: Test plan from Step 1
- **Output**: Rating score (0-10), feedback, improvement suggestions

### Step 3: Verify Rating Enforcement
- **Agent**: QA
- **Validation**:
  - Score < 7 rejected
  - Score >= 7 approved
  - Rating recorded in registry
- **Output**: Validation report

## Agents Used
- Planner (creates test plans)
- Orchestrator (rates plans via response-rater)
- Developer (generates test artifacts)
- QA (validates rating enforcement)

## Skills Used
- `response-rater` - Plan quality evaluation
- `plan-generator` - Test plan creation

## Expected Outputs
- Test plan: `.claude/context/artifacts/test-plan-{id}.json`
- Rating artifact: `.claude/context/runs/{run_id}/plans/{plan_id}-rating.json`
- Validation report: `.claude/context/artifacts/rating-validation-{id}.json`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] response-rater skill invoked correctly
- [ ] Rating score captured (0-10 scale)
- [ ] Plans scoring < 7 rejected with feedback
- [ ] Plans scoring >= 7 approved for execution
- [ ] Rating recorded in `.claude/context/runs/{run_id}/plans/{plan_id}-rating.json`
- [ ] Feedback includes specific improvement suggestions
- [ ] Plan iteration supported until score >= 7

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low-Quality Plan (Expected Score < 7)
```
1. Generate incomplete plan (missing risk mitigation)
2. Rate plan with response-rater
3. Verify score < 7
4. Confirm rejection with feedback
5. Improve plan based on feedback
6. Re-rate until score >= 7
```

### Scenario 2: High-Quality Plan (Expected Score >= 7)
```
1. Generate comprehensive plan (all rubric criteria met)
2. Rate plan with response-rater
3. Verify score >= 7
4. Confirm approval for execution
5. Verify rating recorded in registry
```

### Scenario 3: Iterative Improvement
```
1. Start with score 5/10 plan
2. Apply feedback from response-rater
3. Re-rate, achieve score 6/10
4. Apply more feedback
5. Re-rate, achieve score 8/10
6. Proceed to execution
```

## Example Prompts
```
"Test the plan rating enforcement"
"Validate that response-rater correctly scores plans"
"Create a low-quality plan and verify it's rejected"
"Test plan iteration until passing score achieved"
```
