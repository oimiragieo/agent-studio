# CUJ-019: Performance Optimization

## User Goal
Optimize performance of system or component.

## Trigger
- `/performance --target api/users`
- "Optimize performance"
- "Performance tuning"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `performance-flow.yaml`

### Baseline Measurement (Step 0.5)
- Performance Engineer captures baseline metrics before optimization
- Measures response time, throughput, resource utilization
- Stores baseline in `baseline-metrics.json` artifact
- Used for before/after comparison

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates optimization plan
- Analyzes performance requirements and targets
- Coordinates with Performance Engineer for analysis strategy
- Defines optimization goals and success criteria
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`

### Step 1: Performance Analysis
- Performance Engineer profiles system
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Measures baseline

### Step 2: Optimization Planning
- Architect reviews strategy
- Plans optimizations
- Validates approach

### Step 3: Implementation
- Developer implements optimizations
- Applies performance improvements
- Validates changes

### Step 4: Validation
- QA validates improvements
- Measures performance gains
- Confirms optimization

## Agents Used
- Performance Engineer → Architect → Developer → QA

## Skills Used
- Performance profiling tools

## Expected Outputs
- Performance analysis report
- Optimization plan
- Optimized code
- Performance metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified (artifact: bottleneck-report.json)
- [ ] Optimizations applied (artifact: dev-manifest.json)
- [ ] Performance improved (artifact: performance-comparison.json, validated by gate file)
- [ ] Metrics validated (artifact: benchmark-results.json)

## Example Prompts
```
/performance --target api/users
"Optimize the authentication flow"
"Performance tuning for the dashboard"
```
