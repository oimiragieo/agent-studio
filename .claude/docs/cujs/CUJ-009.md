# CUJ-009: Component Scaffolding

## User Goal
Generate rule-compliant component boilerplate.

## Trigger
- "Scaffold a UserProfile component"
- `/scaffold component UserProfile`
- "Generate component"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0: Planning Phase (Optional for Simple Components)
- Planner creates implementation plan (required for all components)
- Analyzes component requirements
- Determines framework and structure
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`
- Note: For very simple components, this step may be skipped for speed

### Step 1: Component Analysis
- Developer identifies component type
- Determines framework (React, Vue, etc.)

### Step 2: Scaffolding
- scaffolder skill queries rule index
- Generates boilerplate following rules
- Creates supporting files (types, tests, etc.)

### Step 3: Customization
- Developer reviews generated code
- Customizes as needed
- Adds business logic

### Step 4: Validation
- rule-auditor validates compliance
- Fixes any violations
- Ensures quality

## Agents Used
- Developer

## Skills Used
- `scaffolder` - Code generation
- `rule-auditor` - Compliance validation

## Expected Outputs
- Component files
- Type definitions
- Test files
- Supporting files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Component generated (artifact: component-files.json)
- [ ] Rules compliant (validated by rule-auditor, gate file)
- [ ] Tests included (artifact: test-files.json)
- [ ] Ready for customization (validated by gate file)

## Example Prompts
```
"Scaffold a UserProfile component"
"/scaffold component SearchBar"
"Generate a React component for login"
```
