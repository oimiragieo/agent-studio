# CUJ-025: Large Requirements Document Processing

## User Goal
Process a large requirements document (>15KB) without context window overflow.

## Trigger
- User provides a markdown file > 15KB as requirements
- "Plan features from this document" (with large file)
- Automatic detection by workflow_runner.js

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0.5: Feature Distillation (Conditional)
- Analyst agent activated automatically
- Reads large markdown file
- Extracts and structures features
- Creates features-distilled.json
- Preserves critical details, removes verbose content
- Validates: all critical features preserved, acceptance criteria included, dependencies mapped

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner uses features-distilled.json (not raw markdown)
- Creates plan from structured features
- Coordinates with specialists


### Step 0.1: Plan Rating Gate
- Agent: orchestrator
- Type: validation
- Skill: response-rater
- Validates plan quality (minimum score: 7/10)
- Rubric: completeness, feasibility, risk mitigation, agent coverage, integration
- If score < 7: Return to Planner with feedback
- If score >= 7: Proceed to execution
- Records rating in `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/plans/<plan_id>-rating.json`

### Subsequent Steps
- Normal workflow execution continues

## Agents Used
- Analyst (Step 0.5) → Planner (Step 0) → [Other agents]

## Skills Used
- `summarizer` - Feature extraction and summarization
- `response-rater` - Plan quality validation

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Structured data creation (analyst capability for JSON schema generation)

## Expected Outputs
- features-distilled.json (Step 0.5)
- plan-{{workflow_id}}.md (Step 0)
- plan-{{workflow_id}}.json (Step 0)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Large document processed without context overflow
- [ ] Plan rating >= 7/10 (recorded in `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/plans/<plan_id>-rating.json`)
- [ ] Rating recorded in run state (validation: rating file exists)
- ✅ All critical features extracted
- ✅ Features properly structured
- ✅ Planner can create plan from distilled features
- ✅ No information loss on critical details
- ✅ Validation checks pass (all_critical_features_preserved, acceptance_criteria_included, dependencies_mapped)

## Example Prompts
```
"Plan features from requirements.md" (file is 25KB)
"Create plan from this feature document" (large markdown)
```
