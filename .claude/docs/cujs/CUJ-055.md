# CUJ-055: Publishing Retry Logic Test

## User Goal
Validate that publishing retry logic works correctly with exponential backoff and tracks all attempts in registry.

## Trigger
- "Test publishing retry logic"
- "Validate retry with backoff"
- "Check publishing retry tracking"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `skill-only`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates retry logic test plan
- Identifies test scenarios for retry behavior
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`

### Step 1: Test Successful Publishing (No Retry)
- Create artifact with `publishable: true`
- Publish artifact (should succeed on first attempt)
- Verify `publish_status: 'success'` set immediately
- Check `publish_attempts` array has single success entry
- Verify no retry delays occurred

### Step 2: Test Transient Error Retry
- Simulate transient network error (timeout)
- Verify retry logic triggers:
  - First attempt fails
  - Wait 1 second (initial_delay_ms)
  - Second attempt fails
  - Wait 2 seconds (2x backoff)
  - Third attempt succeeds
- Check `publish_attempts` array has 3 entries:
  - Entry 1: `status: 'failed'`, `error: 'Network timeout'`
  - Entry 2: `status: 'failed'`, `error: 'Network timeout'`
  - Entry 3: `status: 'success'`
- Verify `publish_status: 'success'` after final attempt

### Step 3: Test Max Retries Exceeded
- Simulate persistent error (permission denied)
- Verify retry logic stops after max_attempts (3):
  - Attempt 1: fails, wait 1s
  - Attempt 2: fails, wait 2s
  - Attempt 3: fails, wait 4s (max_delay_ms: 8000)
  - No 4th attempt
- Check `publish_status: 'failed'` after max retries
- Verify `publish_error` contains final error message
- Check `publish_attempts` array has exactly 3 failed entries

### Step 4: Test Exponential Backoff Timing
- Measure actual delays between retry attempts
- Verify delays match exponential backoff:
  - Delay 1: ~1000ms (initial_delay_ms)
  - Delay 2: ~2000ms (2x)
  - Delay 3: ~4000ms (4x, capped at max_delay_ms: 8000)
- Check delays don't exceed max_delay_ms

### Step 5: Test Retry Attempt Tracking
- Verify each retry attempt recorded in `publish_attempts`:
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format
  - `status`: 'success' or 'failed'
  - `error`: Error message (if failed)
  - `target`: Publish target (e.g., 'project_feed')
- Check timestamps are sequential
- Verify error messages preserved for failed attempts

### Step 6: Test Registry Update After Each Attempt
- Verify `updateArtifactPublishingStatus()` called after each attempt
- Check registry updated incrementally:
  - After attempt 1: `publish_attempts` has 1 entry
  - After attempt 2: `publish_attempts` has 2 entries
  - After attempt 3: `publish_attempts` has 3 entries
- Verify registry persisted after each update

### Step 7: Test Permanent Error (No Retry)
- Simulate permanent error (invalid artifact format)
- Verify no retry attempted (fails immediately)
- Check `publish_status: 'failed'` set immediately
- Verify `publish_attempts` has single failed entry
- Check `publish_error` contains permanent error message

## Agents Used
- Planner (retry test planning)
- QA (retry logic validation)

## Skills Used
- `artifact-publisher` - Publishing with retry logic
- `plan-generator` - Creating retry test plan

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Retry configuration: `max_attempts: 3`, `backoff_strategy: exponential`, `initial_delay_ms: 1000`, `max_delay_ms: 8000`
- Publishing status tracking: `updateArtifactPublishingStatus()` in `run-manager.mjs`
- Registry persistence: `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/artifact-registry.json`

## Expected Outputs
- Retry test plan: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`
- Test artifacts with various publishing scenarios
- Registry files with retry attempt tracking: `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/artifact-registry.json`
- Retry validation report: `publishing-retry-report.json`
- Timing measurements for backoff delays

## Success Criteria

Each criterion references verifiable artifacts for objective pass/fail validation:
- [ ] Successful publishing: no retry, immediate success (artifact: registry with `publish_status: 'success'`, validated by gate file)
- [ ] Transient error retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (artifact: registry with 3 entries in `publish_attempts`, validated by timing logs)
- [ ] Max retries exceeded: stops after 3 attempts, `publish_status: 'failed'` (artifact: registry with exactly 3 failed entries, validated by registry content)
- [ ] Exponential backoff timing: delays are 1s, 2s, 4s (validated by timing measurements in retry report)
- [ ] Retry attempts tracked: each attempt in `publish_attempts` with timestamp, status, error (validated by registry schema: `.claude/schemas/artifact-registry.schema.json`)
- [ ] Registry updated incrementally: `publish_attempts` grows with each attempt (validated by registry snapshots)
- [ ] Permanent error: no retry, immediate failure (artifact: registry with single failed entry, validated by error type check)

## Example Prompts

"Test publishing retry logic"
"Validate exponential backoff works"
"Check if retry attempts are tracked correctly"
