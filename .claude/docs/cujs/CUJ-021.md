# CUJ-021: Mobile Development

## User Goal
Develop mobile application features.

## Trigger
- `/mobile`

- "iOS/Android feature"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `mobile-flow.yaml`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates mobile development plan
- Analyzes mobile requirements and platform choices
- Coordinates with Mobile Developer for mobile strategy
- Defines mobile architecture and platform approach
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`


### Step 0.1: Plan Rating Gate
- Agent: orchestrator
- Type: validation
- Skill: response-rater
- Validates plan quality (minimum score: 7/10)
- Rubric: completeness, feasibility, risk mitigation, agent coverage, integration
- If score < 7: Return to Planner with feedback
- If score >= 7: Proceed to execution
- Records rating in `.claude/context/runs/<run_id>/plans/<plan_id>-rating.json`
