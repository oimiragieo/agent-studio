# CUJ-022: AI System Development

## User Goal
Develop AI/LLM features and systems.

## Trigger
- `/ai-system`
- "AI feature development"
- "LLM integration"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `ai-system-flow.yaml`

### Step 0: Planning Phase
- Planner creates AI system development plan
- Analyzes AI requirements and model selection
- Coordinates with Model Orchestrator for multi-model strategy
- Defines AI architecture and integration approach
- Outputs: `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`, `plan-{{workflow_id}}.json`

### Step 1: Model Orchestration
- Model Orchestrator plans routing
- Selects appropriate models
- Designs multi-model strategy

### Step 2: LLM Architecture
- LLM Architect designs RAG pipeline
- Plans prompt engineering
- Designs AI system

### Step 3: API Design
- API Designer creates AI API
- Designs endpoints
- Plans integration

### Step 4: Implementation
- Developer implements AI features
- Integrates models
- Tests functionality

### Step 5: Quality Validation
- QA validates AI quality
- Tests safety measures
- Ensures reliability

## Agents Used
- Model Orchestrator → LLM Architect → API Designer → Developer → QA

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- AI/LLM tools (platform-specific AI/LLM integration tools)

## Expected Outputs
- AI system design
- RAG pipeline
- Prompt templates
- AI API implementation

## Success Criteria
- ✅ AI system designed
- ✅ Models integrated
- ✅ Safety validated
- ✅ Quality ensured

## Example Prompts
```
/ai-system
"Build RAG system for document search"
"Integrate LLM for chat feature"
```
