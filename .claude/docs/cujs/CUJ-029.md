# CUJ-029: Cloud Integration Workflow

## User Goal
Separate cloud integration from business logic implementation.

## Trigger
- "Implement cloud storage integration"
- "Add GCP Pub/Sub to application"
- Business logic needs cloud services

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `greenfield-fullstack.yaml`

### Step 7: Business Logic Implementation
- Developer implements core features
- Creates interfaces/stubs for cloud services
- Uses cloud services via interfaces
- Focuses on application logic
- Uses infrastructure-config.json for resource names

### Step 7.5: Cloud Integration (NEW)
- Cloud-Integrator implements actual cloud clients
- Configures authentication (ADC, service accounts)
- Creates cloud service modules
- Implements error handling and retry logic
- Supports both emulators and production
- Validates emulator connectivity and functionality

### Step 8+: Validation and Testing
- Multi-AI validation
- QA testing with emulators
- Production deployment

## Agents Used
- Developer → Cloud-Integrator → Model-Orchestrator → QA

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Cloud SDK integration (platform-specific cloud SDKs)
- Authentication configuration (cloud provider authentication setup)
- Emulator setup (local cloud emulator configuration)

## Expected Outputs
- Business logic code (Step 7)
- Cloud integration code (Step 7.5)
- cloud-integration.json (Step 7.5)
- Emulator configuration

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Business logic separated from cloud code
- ✅ Cloud integration works with emulators
- ✅ Production-ready cloud clients
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Authentication configured correctly
- ✅ Emulator validation passed

## Example Prompts
```
"Add GCP storage to file upload feature"
"Implement Pub/Sub messaging for notifications"
```
