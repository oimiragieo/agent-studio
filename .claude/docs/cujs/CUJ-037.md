# CUJ-037: Multi-Phase Project Execution

## User Goal
Test hierarchical planning with phase boundaries for large projects (>3000 lines), ensuring master plan and phase plans are structured correctly and only active phase plans are loaded.

## Trigger
- "Plan large project with phases"
- "Test multi-phase execution"
- "Validate phase boundaries"

## Workflow

**Execution Mode**: `greenfield-fullstack.yaml`

### Step 0: Planning Phase (Hierarchical)
- Planner analyzes large project requirements (>3000 lines)
- Detects project exceeds phase boundary threshold (3000 lines)
- Organizes project into logical phases based on:
  - Dependencies between features/components
  - Logical separation (frontend/backend, features)
  - File count and complexity
- Creates hierarchical plan structure:
  - **Master Plan** (`plan-{{workflow_id}}.md`): <5KB overview
    - Lists all phases with status
    - Location of each phase plan document
    - Overall progress tracking
  - **Phase Plans** (`plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-{n}.json`): <20KB each
    - Tasks for this phase only
    - Agent assignments, dependencies, test requirements
    - Artifacts, status tracking
- Validates phase organization:
  - Each phase 1-3k lines of code
  - Phase boundaries align with feature boundaries
  - Dependencies respected (earlier phases before later phases)

### Step 1: Phase 1 Execution
- Orchestrator loads master plan
- Identifies Phase 1 as active
- Loads only `plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-1.json` (not all phases)
- Executes Phase 1 tasks
- Updates Phase 1 status in master plan
- Creates Phase 1 artifacts

### Step 2: Phase 2 Execution
- Orchestrator checks master plan
- Identifies Phase 2 as next active phase
- Verifies Phase 1 dependencies are satisfied
- Loads only `plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-2.json`
- Executes Phase 2 tasks
- Updates Phase 2 status in master plan
- Creates Phase 2 artifacts

### Step 3: Phase N Execution
- Continues for remaining phases
- Each phase loads only its own plan document
- Master plan updated with progress
- Dependencies verified before each phase

### Step 4: Phase Boundary Validation
- Verify master plan is <5KB
- Verify each phase plan is <20KB
- Confirm only active phase loaded (not all phases)
- Validate phase dependencies are correct
- Check phase boundaries are logical

## Agents Used
- Planner (hierarchical planning)
- Orchestrator (phase execution coordination)
- [Other agents as specified in phase plans]

## Skills Used
- `plan-generator` - Hierarchical plan creation
- `dependency-analyzer` - Dependency analysis for phase organization

## Capabilities/Tools Used
- Phase boundary detection (planner capability)

## Expected Outputs
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}.md` - Master plan (<5KB)
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-1.json` - Phase 1 plan (<20KB)
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-2.json` - Phase 2 plan (<20KB)
- `plan-{{workflow_id}}-phase-N.json` - Additional phase plans (<20KB each)
- Phase execution artifacts
- Phase boundary validation report

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Project correctly identified as multi-phase (>3000 lines)
- ✅ Phases organized logically (dependencies, features, complexity)
- ✅ Master plan created and <5KB
- ✅ Phase plans created and each <20KB
- ✅ Only active phase plan loaded during execution
- ✅ Phase dependencies respected
- ✅ Master plan updated with phase progress
- ✅ Phase boundaries align with feature boundaries
- ✅ Each phase contains 1-3k lines of code

## Example Prompts
```
"Plan a large e-commerce platform with multiple phases"
"Test multi-phase project execution"
"Validate phase boundaries for a 5000-line project"
```

## Phase Organization Rules

### Phase Boundary Detection
- **Threshold**: 3000 lines of code triggers phase organization
- **Organization Criteria**:
  - Dependencies between features/components
  - Logical separation (frontend/backend, features)
  - File count and complexity
- **Phase Size**: Each phase should contain 1-3k lines of code
- **Dependency Order**: Earlier phases must complete before later phases

### Master Plan Structure
- High-level overview with phases
- Simple list of all phases with status
- Location of each phase plan document
- Overall progress tracking
- Must be <5KB for easy ingestion

### Phase Plan Structure
- Tasks for this phase only
- Agent assignments, dependencies, test requirements
- Artifacts, status tracking
- Each phase plan <20KB (prevents context overload)
