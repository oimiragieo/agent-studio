# Getting Started with Agent Studio

**5-Minute Quick Start** | [Full Documentation](../CLAUDE.md)

> **What is Agent Studio?**
>
> A multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code. Instead of one AI assistant, you get a coordinated team of 40+ specialized agents—developers, architects, QA, security reviewers—working together on your tasks.
>
> **Key Difference**: Router delegates to specialized agents. Memory persists across sessions. Self-evolves when capabilities missing.

## Overview

Agent Studio transforms Claude Code from a single assistant into an entire development team:

- **Router-First**: All requests analyzed and delegated to specialized agents
- **40+ Specialized Agents**: Developer, planner, architect, QA, security, domain experts
- **426 Skills**: Reusable capabilities (TDD, debugging, security review, etc.)
- **Persistent Memory**: Context never lost between sessions
- **Self-Evolution**: Creates new agents/skills when gaps detected
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in security and verification checks

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed
- Node.js 18+ (for some tooling)
- Git (recommended)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Enter

```bash
cd your-project
# Agent Studio files live in .claude/
```

All configuration, agents, skills, and workflows are in the `.claude/` directory. You don't need to touch these files to use the system—just interact naturally with Claude Code.

### 2. Your First Interaction

Just ask Claude Code anything. The **Router** automatically:

- Analyzes your request
- Selects the best agent(s)
- Spawns them to handle your task

**Example:**

```
You: "Fix the login bug in auth.ts"
[ROUTER] → Spawns DEVELOPER agent → Bug fixed with tests
```

### 3. Key Concepts

| Concept       | What It Does                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Router**    | Analyzes requests, spawns the right agent(s)                  |
| **Agents**    | Specialized workers (developer, planner, QA, architect, etc.) |
| **Skills**    | Reusable capabilities agents invoke to execute tasks          |
| **Memory**    | Persistent context across sessions—nothing gets forgotten     |
| **Tasks**     | Trackable work units with dependencies and status             |
| **Workflows** | Multi-agent coordination patterns for complex work            |

## Common Workflows

### Bug Fix

```
You: "Fix the null pointer in utils.ts"
→ Router spawns DEVELOPER
→ DEVELOPER uses TDD and debugging skills
→ Bug fixed with regression tests
```

### New Feature

```
You: "Add user authentication"
→ Router spawns PLANNER + SECURITY-ARCHITECT (parallel)
→ Plan created and security-reviewed
→ Tasks created from plan
→ DEVELOPER implements each task
→ QA validates with comprehensive tests
```

### Code Review

```
You: "Review PR #123"
→ Router spawns CODE-REVIEWER
→ Two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality)
→ Detailed feedback with actionable recommendations
```

### Architecture Documentation

```
You: "Generate C4 diagrams for the system"
→ Router spawns C4-CONTEXT agent
→ System context diagram created
→ Follow-up spawns for container/component/code views
→ Complete architecture documentation
```

## Understanding the Router

The Router is the entry point for ALL requests. It acts like a project manager:

1. **Analyzes** the request (complexity, domain, security risk)
2. **Selects** the best agent(s) from 40+ available agents
3. **Spawns** agents using the Task tool
4. **Tracks** progress using the task system
5. **Coordinates** multi-agent workflows when needed

The Router **never implements work directly**—it always delegates to specialized agents.

## Available Agents

Agent Studio includes 40+ specialized agents organized into categories:

### Core Agents

- **developer**: Bug fixes, implementation, coding tasks
- **planner**: Feature planning, task breakdown, estimation
- **architect**: System design, architecture decisions
- **qa**: Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- **technical-writer**: Documentation creation and updates

### Specialized Agents

- **security-architect**: Security reviews, threat modeling
- **code-reviewer**: PR reviews, code quality analysis
- **devops**: Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD
- **incident-responder**: Production incidents, debugging
- **database-architect**: Schema design, optimization

### Domain Experts

- **typescript-pro**, **python-pro**, **rust-pro**, **golang-pro**
- **fastapi-pro**, **nextjs-pro**, **react-pro**
- **ios-pro**, **expo-mobile-developer**
- **data-engineer**, **graphql-pro**

### Architecture & Diagrams

- **c4-context**, **c4-container**, **c4-component**, **c4-code**

For the complete list, see the [Agent Routing Table](../CLAUDE.md#3-agent-routing-table).

## Skills: Reusable Capabilities

Agents don't just "know things"—they **invoke skills** to execute work. Skills are reusable, tested capabilities.

**Examples:**

- `tdd` - Test-driven development workflow
- `debugging` - Systematic debugging process
- `security-architect` - Security review patterns
- `plan-generator` - Planning methodology
- `verification-before-completion` - Quality gates

The skill catalog contains **426 skills** organized into 20+ categories. Browse the [Skill Catalog](.claude/context/artifacts/skill-catalog.md) to see what's available.

## Memory: Nothing Gets Forgotten

Agent Studio uses a persistent memory system so context carries across sessions:

- **learnings.md**: Patterns, solutions, gotchas
- **decisions.md**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **issues.md**: Known blockers and workarounds
- **gotchas.json**, **patterns.json**: Structured memory
- **sessions/**: Per-session history

Agents read memory before starting work and record findings after completion. This means you can resume work days later without repeating context.

## Task Management

Complex work gets broken into trackable tasks with dependencies:

```
You: "Refactor authentication system"
→ PLANNER creates task breakdown
  - Task 1: Backup existing auth code
  - Task 2: Design new architecture (blocked by Task 1)
  - Task 3: Implement new auth service (blocked by Task 2)
  - Task 4: Migrate data (blocked by Task 3)
  - Task 5: QA validation (blocked by Task 4)
→ DEVELOPER claims and completes Task 1
→ Task 2 becomes available
→ Process continues through completion
```

Tasks track status, blockers, assignees, and metadata. Use `TaskList()` to see current work.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

For complex work requiring multiple perspectives, agents work in **parallel** or **sequential** phases:

**Parallel Example** (concurrent work):

```
You: "Add payment processing"
→ PLANNER designs feature
→ SECURITY-ARCHITECT reviews design (parallel)
→ DEVELOPER implements (after reviews)
→ QA validates (after implementation)
```

**Sequential Example** (dependent phases):

```
You: "Migrate to new database"
→ ARCHITECT designs migration strategy
→ DEVELOPER implements migration scripts
→ DEVOPS sets up infrastructure
→ QA validates data integrity
```

The Router automatically orchestrates these workflows based on complexity.

## Self-Evolution (EVOLVE Workflow)

When no agent exists for your domain, Agent Studio automatically creates one using the **EVOLVE workflow**—a research-backed, quality-gated process:

```
You: "Review iOS UX patterns"
→ Router finds no ios-ux-reviewer agent
→ Router spawns EVOLUTION-ORCHESTRATOR
→ EVOLVE workflow executes:
  E - Evaluate: Confirm capability gap
  V - Validate: Check naming/conflicts
  O - Obtain: Research best practices (3+ queries, MANDATORY)
  L - Lock: Create artifact using creator skill
  V - Verify: Quality assurance (no placeholders, complete protocols)
  E - Enable: Register in routing tables
→ New ios-ux-reviewer agent ready
→ New agent handles the review
```

### EVOLVE Highlights

- **Research-Backed**: Every artifact researched with 3+ external sources
- **Quality-Gated**: 6 phases with exit conditions that MUST pass
- **Audit Trail**: Complete research reports and evolution history
- **Auto-Start (Optional)**: Set `EVOLVE_AUTO_START=true` to auto-trigger evolution

**Default**: Manual EVOLVE trigger (safer for production).

Same process creates skills, workflows, hooks, and schemas. The system evolves to meet your needs while maintaining quality.
