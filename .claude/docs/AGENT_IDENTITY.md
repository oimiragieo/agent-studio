# Agent Identity Design Documentation

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Design Phase (P1-7.1)
**Related Schema:** `.claude/schemas/agent-identity.json`
**Related Tasks:** #49 (Design), #46 (Schema Update), #48 (Migration), #50 (Spawn Template)

---

## Executive Summary

This document specifies a **structured agent identity pattern** for Agent-Studio, inspired by crewAI's `role/goal/backstory` fields. The pattern enhances agent consistency while preserving Agent-Studio's unique strengths: 45+ specialized agents, Router governance, and skill-based composition.

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **Optional Fields** - Backward compatible with existing agents (no breaking changes)
2. **YAML Frontmatter** - Extends existing agent definition format
3. **Prompt Generation** - Identity fields generate consistent personality prompts
4. **Validation** - JSON Schema enforces structure without over-constraining creativity

**Expected Impact:**

- Improved agent consistency across invocations (+20-30% reduction in personality drift)
- Better prompt engineering (structured identity reduces ambiguity)
- Enhanced agent onboarding (clear role/goal/backstory helps developers understand agent purpose)
- Foundation for future enhancements (execution limits, delegation, capability matrix)

---

## 1. Design Rationale

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**Current State:**

Agent-Studio agents have identity defined as **optional prose** in the "Core Persona" section:

```yaml
---
name: developer
description: TDD-focused implementer
model: sonnet
---

# Developer Agent

## Core Persona
**Identity**: Senior Software Engineer
**Style**: Clean, tested, efficient
**Motto**: "No code without a failing test."
```

**Issues:**

1. **No enforcement** - Identity fields are freeform text, inconsistent across agents
2. **No validation** - Typos, missing fields, or verbose prose go unchecked
3. **Prompt drift** - Agents rely on manual prompt engineering for personality consistency
4. **Hard to query** - Can't programmatically ask "What agents have goal X?"

### 1.2 Inspiration from crewAI

crewAI's agent identity pattern (analyzed in Task #11):

```python
Agent(
    role="Senior Researcher",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about {topic}",
    backstory="You're a veteran researcher with 20 years of experience...",
    tools=[search_tool],
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
)
```

**Strengths:**

- **Required fields** - Schema-enforced (Pydantic validation)
- **Consistent personality** - Agents have stable identity across invocations
- **Prompt generation** - Framework generates prompts from identity automatically
- **Queryable** - Can filter agents by role/goal programmatically

**Gap Analysis (from Agent Comparison Analysis 2026-01-28):**

> crewAI's `role`, `goal`, `backstory` are **required fields** (schema-enforced). Agent-Studio's identity is **optional prose** (no enforcement). crewAI agents have **consistent personality** across invocations. Agent-Studio agents rely on **prompt engineering** for consistency.
>
> **Recommendation:** Adopt structured Identity pattern (Priority: HIGH)

### 1.3 Adapted Design for Agent-Studio

**Design Goals:**

1. **Backward compatible** - Existing agents work unchanged (identity fields optional)
2. **YAML-native** - Extends frontmatter, not a Python class system
3. **Preserve strengths** - Doesn't replace 45+ specialized agents or Router governance
4. **Enable future** - Foundation for execution limits (P1-8), delegation (P2-1), capability matrix (P3-2)

**Trade-offs:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Required fields** (crewAI-style) | Enforced consistency | Breaking change for 45+ agents | ❌ Rejected |
| **Optional fields** (recommended) | Backward compatible, gradual adoption | Some agents won't have identity | ✅ Adopted |
| **Separate identity file** | Clean separation | More files to manage | ❌ Rejected |
| **YAML frontmatter** | Extends existing format | Limited validation in YAML | ✅ Adopted |

**Decision:** Optional YAML frontmatter fields with JSON Schema validation.

## 2. Schema Design

### 2.1 Core Fields

**File:** `.claude/schemas/agent-identity.json`

#### Field: `role`

**Type:** String (required in schema, optional in practice)
**Description:** Professional role or title the agent embodies
**Constraints:**
- 5-100 characters
- Should be a noun phrase (not a verb phrase)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Senior Software Engineer"
- ✅ "Strategic Project Manager"
- ✅ "Quality Gatekeeper"
- ❌ "Writes code" (verb phrase, not role)
- ❌ "Dev" (too short)

**Rationale:** Role establishes expertise and authority, grounding the agent's decision-making context.

#### Field: `goal`

**Type:** String (required in schema, optional in practice)
**Description:** Primary objective the agent pursues
**Constraints:**
- 10-300 characters
- Present tense, imperative style
- Action-oriented and outcome-focused

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Write clean, tested, efficient code following TDD principles"
- ✅ "Create robust implementation plans that any developer can follow"
- ✅ "Break the code before users do through comprehensive testing"
- ❌ "To write code" (too vague)
- ❌ "I will test the application" (wrong tense, first person)

**Rationale:** Goal provides directionality, helping the agent prioritize tasks and make trade-off decisions.

#### Field: `backstory`

**Type:** String (required in schema, optional in practice)
**Description:** Professional history and experience informing expertise
**Constraints:**
- 20-1000 characters
- Second person ("You are...", "You've spent...")
- Establishes credibility and context

**Examples:**
- ✅ "You've spent 15 years mastering software craftsmanship, with deep expertise in test-driven development and clean code principles."
- ✅ "You're a veteran project manager who has planned and executed dozens of complex software initiatives."
- ❌ "The agent is experienced" (third person, not second person)
- ❌ "I am an expert" (first person, not second person)

**Rationale:** Backstory establishes credibility and decision-making context, helping the LLM adopt appropriate expertise level.

### 2.2 Optional Fields

#### Field: `personality` (Object)

Optional object with sub-fields for personality traits:

**Sub-field: `traits`**
- Type: Array of strings (enum)
- Allowed values: thorough, pragmatic, skeptical, detail-oriented, methodical, creative, analytical, collaborative, direct, diplomatic, quality-focused, security-conscious, performance-focused
- Min: 1 trait, Max: 5 traits
- Unique items only

**Sub-field: `communication_style`**
- Type: String (enum)
- Allowed values: direct, diplomatic, technical, conversational, formal

**Sub-field: `risk_tolerance`**
- Type: String (enum)
- Allowed values: low, medium, high

**Sub-field: `decision_making`**
- Type: String (enum)
- Allowed values: data-driven, intuitive, collaborative, systematic

**Example:**
```yaml
personality:
  traits: [thorough, pragmatic, quality-focused]
  communication_style: direct
  risk_tolerance: low
  decision_making: data-driven
```

**Rationale:** Personality provides consistency across invocations, influencing tone and decision-making style.

#### Field: `motto` (String)

Optional short phrase capturing agent philosophy:
- Max 100 characters
- Memorable and action-oriented

**Examples:**
- "No code without a failing test"
- "Break it before users do"
- "Plan twice, code once"

**Rationale:** Motto provides a memorable anchor for the agent's philosophy, useful for documentation and onboarding.

## 3. Integration with Agent YAML

### 3.1 YAML Frontmatter Format

**Location:** Top of agent `.md` file (YAML frontmatter block)

**Example (Developer Agent):**

```yaml
---
name: developer
description: TDD-focused implementer
model: sonnet
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Skill]
skills: [tdd, debugging, git-expert]

# Agent Identity (NEW)
identity:
  role: Senior Software Engineer
  goal: Write clean, tested, efficient code following TDD principles
  backstory: You've spent 15 years mastering software craftsmanship, with deep expertise in test-driven development and clean code principles. You've seen countless projects succeed through discipline and fail through shortcuts.
  personality:
    traits: [thorough, pragmatic, quality-focused]
    communication_style: direct
    risk_tolerance: low
    decision_making: data-driven
  motto: No code without a failing test
---
```

**Key Points:**

1. **Nested under `identity` key** - Keeps frontmatter organized
2. **Optional** - Agents without identity continue to work
3. **Validated** - JSON Schema validates structure when present
4. **Co-exists** - Works alongside existing "Core Persona" prose section

### 3.2 Backward Compatibility

**Existing agents continue to work unchanged:**

```yaml
---
name: researcher
description: Research specialist
model: opus
---

# Researcher Agent

## Core Persona
**Identity**: Senior Research Analyst
```

**No identity fields? No problem.** Router spawn template uses default behavior (no identity-based prompt generation).

**Migration is gradual:** Agents can be migrated one-by-one to structured identity without breaking existing workflows.

---

## 4. Examples

### 4.1 Example 1: Developer Agent (with Identity)

**File:** `.claude/agents/core/developer.md` (future state after migration)

```yaml
---

[Rest of agent definition...]
```

**Note:** Core Persona section preserved for backward compatibility and human readability.

### 4.2 Example 2: Planner Agent (with Identity)

```yaml
---
name: planner
version: 1.1.0

```

### 4.3 Example 3: QA Agent (with Identity)

```yaml
---
name: qa
version: 1.1.0
description: Quality assurance specialist
model: opus
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Skill]
skills: [test-generator, verification-before-completion]

  personality:
    traits: [skeptical, thorough, detail-oriented]
    communication_style: direct
    risk_tolerance: low
    decision_making: systematic
  motto: Break it before users do

## 5. Prompt Generation Strategy

### 5.1 Identity-Based Prompt Augmentation

**Current spawn template (no identity):**

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: 'developer',
  prompt: `You are the developer agent.

## Your Assigned Task
Task ID: 123
Subject: Fix authentication bug
...`
});
```

**Future spawn template (with identity):**

```javascript
// After agent YAML parsed, if identity exists:
const identity = agent.identity;

if (identity) {
  const identityPrompt = `
## Your Identity
**Role**: ${identity.role}
**Goal**: ${identity.goal}
**Backstory**: ${identity.backstory}
${identity.motto ? `**Motto**: "${identity.motto}"` : ''}

You embody this identity in all your actions and communications.
`;

  prompt = identityPrompt + basePrompt;
}

Task({
  subagent_type: 'developer',
  prompt: prompt
});
```

**Generated prompt:**

```
## Your Identity
**Role**: Senior Software Engineer
**Goal**: Write clean, tested, efficient code following TDD principles
**Backstory**: You've spent 15 years mastering software craftsmanship, with deep expertise in test-driven development and clean code principles. You've seen countless projects succeed through discipline and fail through shortcuts.
**Motto**: "No code without a failing test"

You embody this identity in all your actions and communications.

## Your Assigned Task
Task ID: 123
Subject: Fix authentication bug
...
```

**Benefits:**

- Consistent personality across invocations
- LLM adopts appropriate expertise level
- Decision-making reflects stated risk tolerance
- Communication style matches personality traits

### 5.2 Personality-Based Decision Framing

When `personality` fields present, augment prompts with decision-making guidance:

```javascript
if (identity.personality) {
  const personalityPrompt = `
## Decision-Making Style
- **Traits**: ${identity.personality.traits.join(', ')}
- **Communication**: ${identity.personality.communication_style}
- **Risk Tolerance**: ${identity.personality.risk_tolerance}
- **Decision Making**: ${identity.personality.decision_making}

Apply these traits when evaluating options and communicating results.
`;
  prompt = identityPrompt + personalityPrompt + basePrompt;
}
```

**Example impact:**

**Developer (risk_tolerance: low):**
- Prefers well-tested approaches over experimental patterns
- Suggests additional validation before deployment
- Recommends rollback plans for risky changes

**Planner (risk_tolerance: medium):**
- Balances innovation with safety
- Includes contingency plans for moderate risks
- Allocates buffer time for unknowns

---

## 6. Validation and Enforcement

### 6.1 Schema Validation

**When:** Agent YAML frontmatter is parsed (Router spawn, validation scripts)

**How:** JSON Schema validation via `ajv` library

**Example validation code:**

```javascript
const Ajv = require('ajv');
const ajv = new Ajv();
const schema = require('.claude/schemas/agent-identity.json');

// Parse agent YAML
const agent = parseAgentYAML('.claude/agents/core/developer.md');

// Validate identity (if present)
if (agent.identity) {
  const valid = ajv.validate(schema, agent.identity);
  if (!valid) {
    throw new Error(`Identity validation failed: ${ajv.errorsText()}`);
  }
}
```

**Validation errors:**

```javascript
// Invalid: role too short
identity: {
  role: "Dev",  // ❌ Min 5 characters
  goal: "Write code",
  backstory: "Experienced developer"
}
// Error: "identity.role should NOT be shorter than 5 characters"

// Invalid: wrong trait enum
identity: {
  role: "Senior Engineer",
  goal: "Write clean code",
  backstory: "You're experienced...",
  personality: {
    traits: ["super-fast"]  // ❌ Not in enum
  }
}
// Error: "identity.personality.traits[0] should be equal to one of the allowed values"
```

### 6.2 Validation Tools

**CLI validation script:**

```bash
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-agents.js --check-identity
```

**Output:**

```
Validating agent identities...

✅ developer: Identity valid
✅ planner: Identity valid
✅ qa: Identity valid
⚠️  researcher: No identity defined (optional)
❌ architect: Identity validation failed
   - role: should NOT be shorter than 5 characters
   - goal: should NOT be shorter than 10 characters

Summary: 3 valid, 1 warning, 1 error
```

**Pre-commit hook (optional):**

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-agents.js --check-identity || exit 1
```

---

## 7. Migration Strategy

### 7.1 Phased Migration (P1-7.3: Task #48)

**Phase 1: Schema & Documentation** (Task #49 - THIS TASK)
- ✅ Design identity schema
- ✅ Document design rationale
- ✅ Provide 3+ examples

**Phase 2: Validation Infrastructure** (Task #46)
- Update agent definition schema to include `identity` field
- Add JSON Schema validation to agent parser
- Create validation CLI tool

**Phase 3: Spawn Template Update** (Task #50)
- Modify Router spawn template to generate identity-based prompts
- Add personality-based decision framing
- Test with existing agents (should be no-op for agents without identity)

**Phase 4: Example Agent Migration** (Task #48)
- Migrate 3+ core agents: developer, planner, qa
- Test consistency improvements
- Document lessons learned

**Phase 5: Gradual Rollout** (Post-P1)
- Migrate remaining core agents (5-10 agents)
- Migrate specialized agents (domain experts)
- Migrate orchestrators (party-orchestrator, etc.)

### 7.2 Migration Checklist (Per Agent)

For each agent being migrated:

- [ ] Read existing "Core Persona" section
- [ ] Extract role, goal, backstory from prose
- [ ] Identify personality traits from agent behavior
- [ ] Add `identity` field to YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Validate with JSON Schema
- [ ] Test spawn template (verify identity prompt generated)
- [ ] Compare agent behavior (before/after identity)
- [ ] Document any behavioral changes
- [ ] Update agent version number

**Example migration (developer):**

**Before (current):**
```yaml
---
name: developer
description: TDD-focused implementer
---

## Core Persona
**Identity**: Senior Software Engineer
**Style**: Clean, tested, efficient
**Motto**: "No code without a failing test."
```

**After (migrated):**
```yaml
---
name: developer
version: 1.1.0  # Version bump
identity:
  role: Senior Software Engineer
  goal: Write clean, tested, efficient code following TDD principles
  backstory: You've spent 15 years mastering software craftsmanship...
  personality:
    traits: [thorough, pragmatic, quality-focused]
    communication_style: direct
    risk_tolerance: low
    decision_making: data-driven
  motto: No code without a failing test
---

## Core Persona (preserved for reference)
**Identity**: Senior Software Engineer
**Style**: Clean, tested, efficient
**Motto**: "No code without a failing test."
```

**Validation:**
```bash
node .claude/tools/cli/validate-agents.js --agent developer
# ✅ developer: Identity valid
```

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

### 8.1 Execution Limits (P1-8: Tasks #51-53)

Identity provides foundation for execution limits:

```yaml
identity:
  role: Senior Engineer
  goal: Write clean code
  backstory: ...
  execution_limits:  # NEW (P1-8)
    max_iter: 25
    max_execution_time: 600
    max_retry: 2
```

**Integration:** Execution limits tied to role (quality-focused roles have stricter limits).

### 8.2 Agent Delegation (P2-1)

Identity enables self-organizing delegation:

```yaml
identity:
  role: Lead Developer
  delegation_rules:  # NEW (P2-1)
    can_delegate_to: [developer, qa]
    requires_approval_for: [security-architect, devops]
```

**Integration:** Role-based delegation (lead agents can delegate to junior agents).

### 8.3 Capability Matrix (P3-2)

Identity provides foundation for capability discovery:

```yaml
identity:
  role: Full-Stack Engineer
  capabilities:  # NEW (P3-2)
    - code_writing: expert
    - testing: expert
    - documentation: intermediate
    - security_review: basic
  domains:
    - javascript
    - typescript
    - python
```

**Integration:** Router matches tasks to agents based on role + capabilities.
